<p>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, &#8220;Fear not; for, behold, I bring you tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you: Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.&#8221; And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying, &#8220;Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace and goodwill towards men.&#8221;</p><br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/programmingpraxis.wordpress.com/8762/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/programmingpraxis.wordpress.com/8762/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=programmingpraxis.com&#038;blog=6649073&#038;post=8762&#038;subd=programmingpraxis&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" />") (commentRss nil "http://programmingpraxis.com/2015/12/22/merry-christmas-2/feed/") (comments nil "1") (content ((url .

With a little bit of algebra, that formula can be written <code>prev = a<sup><small>&minus;1</small></sup> * (next - c) (mod m)</code>, where a<sup><small>&minus;1</small></sup> is the inverse of <code>a (mod m)</code>; that modular inverse always exists because the linear congruential generator requires that <em>a</em> and <em>m</em> are coprime.</p>

Today’s exercise looks at a way that an encryption backdoor can be added to the RSA cryptosystem.</p>
<p>Let’s start by reviewing how RSA works, as we have studied it in a <a href=\"/2010/11/16/rsa-cryptography/\">previous exercise</a>. Two large primes <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are chosen at random; their product <em>n</em> is the modulus of the cryptosystem, and the totient &phi;(<em>pq</em>) of <em>n</em> is (<em>p</em>&minus;1) &times; (<em>q</em>&minus;1). Then two keys are chosen, the encryption key <em>e</em> and the decryption key <em>d</em> such that <em>de</em> &equiv; 1 (mod &phi;(<em>pq</em>)) and gcd(<em>e</em>, &phi;(<em>pq</em>)) = 1. Then a message <em>m</em>, encoded as an integer on the range 0 &lt; <em>m</em> &lt; <em>n</em>, is encrypted as <em>m<sup><small>e</small></sup></em> (mod <em>n</em>) and the resulting ciphertext <em>c</em> is decrypted as <em>c<sup><small>d</small></sup></em> (mod <em>n</em>). In practice, <em>e</em> is usually 2<sup><small>16</small></sup>+1 = 65537 (that choice simplifies the arithmetic involved in encryption and decryption), <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are <em>t</em>-bit integers with <em>t</em> &isin; {512, 1024} bits, and there are algorithms that allow the message to be any length (not limited to <em>n</em>), though we won’t look at them here because they are arcane and not germane to the RSA backdoor.</p>
<p>The encryption backdoor is inserted in the key generation process. The backdoor key <em>a</em> is chosen as a random prime of length 3<em>t</em>/4 bits; also chosen are two random primes <em>p</em>‘ and <em>q</em>‘ of length <em>t</em>/4 bits. Then <em>p</em> is computed based on <em>p</em>‘ by the following algorithm:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 [Initialize]: Set <em>k</em> &larr; <em>p</em>‘.<br />
2 [Compute <em>p</em>]: Set <em>p</em> &larr; a &times; k + p’.<br />
3 [Check primality]: If <em>p</em> is prime, return <em>p</em>.<br />
4 [Try again]: Set <em>k</em> &larr; <em>k</em> + 1 and go to Step 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>And likewise for <em>q</em>, which is computed based on <em>q</em>‘. This process must terminate by Dirichlet’s Theorem, which says that for integers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>x</em> with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> coprime, the arithmetic progression <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em> contains infinitely many prime numbers. Once you’ve computed <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the key generation and ciphering processes of the normal RSA algorithm are unchanged.</p>
<p>An attacker who doesn’t know the backdoor key <em>a</em> can read an encrypted message <em>m</em> only by factoring <em>n</em>, which is difficult; that’s the basis of the secrecy provided by the RSA system. But an attacker who knows the backdoor key <em>a</em> can factor <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) as <em>p</em>‘ &times; <em>q</em>‘, recover <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and thus the decryption key <em>d</em>, and thus read the message <em>m</em>. Factoring <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) is very much easier than factoring <em>n</em>; for instance, if <em>n</em> is a 2048-bit semiprime, <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) is only 512 bits, which can be factored by a single personal computer in a few months, or by an AWS cluster in a few days, or by the supercomputers in the basement of the NSA one morning before you finish your first donut.</p>
<p>In practice, the RSA backdoor would work like this: Each device that performs encryption, say an iPhone or Android tablet, has a unique MAC address or KEK key or serial number that is somehow converted to a backdoor key <em>a</em> that is also unique to the device. (If a single backdoor key <em>a</em> was used for all devices, it could be recovered by a method similar to this <a href=\"/2012/03/20/factoring-multiple-rsa-keys/\">exercise</a>.) The device generates backdoored keys on request, then sends encrypted messages in the normal way. When some police agency wants to read an encrypted message, they request warrants from a judge, seize the device, determine the backdoor key <em>a</em>, and perform the procedure described above.</p>

Today&#8217;s exercise looks at a way that an encryption backdoor can be added to the RSA cryptosystem.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start by reviewing how RSA works, as we have studied it in a <a href=\"/2010/11/16/rsa-cryptography/\">previous exercise</a>. Two large primes <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are chosen at random; their product <em>n</em> is the modulus of the cryptosystem, and the totient &phi;(<em>pq</em>) of <em>n</em> is (<em>p</em>&minus;1) &times; (<em>q</em>&minus;1). Then two keys are chosen, the encryption key <em>e</em> and the decryption key <em>d</em> such that <em>de</em> &equiv; 1 (mod &phi;(<em>pq</em>)) and gcd(<em>e</em>, &phi;(<em>pq</em>)) = 1. Then a message <em>m</em>, encoded as an integer on the range 0 &lt; <em>m</em> &lt; <em>n</em>, is encrypted as <em>m<sup><small>e</small></sup></em> (mod <em>n</em>) and the resulting ciphertext <em>c</em> is decrypted as <em>c<sup><small>d</small></sup></em> (mod <em>n</em>). In practice, <em>e</em> is usually 2<sup><small>16</small></sup>+1 = 65537 (that choice simplifies the arithmetic involved in encryption and decryption), <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> are <em>t</em>-bit integers with <em>t</em> &isin; {512, 1024} bits, and there are algorithms that allow the message to be any length (not limited to <em>n</em>), though we won&#8217;t look at them here because they are arcane and not germane to the RSA backdoor.</p>
<p>The encryption backdoor is inserted in the key generation process. The backdoor key <em>a</em> is chosen as a random prime of length 3<em>t</em>/4 bits; also chosen are two random primes <em>p</em>&#8216; and <em>q</em>&#8216; of length <em>t</em>/4 bits. Then <em>p</em> is computed based on <em>p</em>&#8216; by the following algorithm:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 [Initialize]: Set <em>k</em> &larr; <em>p</em>&#8216;.<br />
2 [Compute <em>p</em>]: Set <em>p</em> &larr; a &times; k + p&#8217;.<br />
3 [Check primality]: If <em>p</em> is prime, return <em>p</em>.<br />
4 [Try again]: Set <em>k</em> &larr; <em>k</em> + 1 and go to Step 2.</p></blockquote>
<p>And likewise for <em>q</em>, which is computed based on <em>q</em>&#8216;. This process must terminate by Dirichlet&#8217;s Theorem, which says that for integers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>x</em> with <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> coprime, the arithmetic progression <em>ax</em> + <em>b</em> contains infinitely many prime numbers. Once you&#8217;ve computed <em>p</em> and <em>q</em>, the key generation and ciphering processes of the normal RSA algorithm are unchanged.</p>
<p>An attacker who doesn&#8217;t know the backdoor key <em>a</em> can read an encrypted message <em>m</em> only by factoring <em>n</em>, which is difficult; that&#8217;s the basis of the secrecy provided by the RSA system. But an attacker who knows the backdoor key <em>a</em> can factor <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) as <em>p</em>&#8216; &times; <em>q</em>&#8216;, recover <em>p</em> and <em>q</em> and thus the decryption key <em>d</em>, and thus read the message <em>m</em>. Factoring <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) is very much easier than factoring <em>n</em>; for instance, if <em>n</em> is a 2048-bit semiprime, <em>n</em> (mod <em>a</em>) is only 512 bits, which can be factored by a single personal computer in a few months, or by an AWS cluster in a few days, or by the supercomputers in the basement of the NSA one morning before you finish your first donut.</p>
<p>In practice, the RSA backdoor would work like this: Each device that performs encryption, say an iPhone or Android tablet, has a unique MAC address or KEK key or serial number that is somehow converted to a backdoor key <em>a</em> that is also unique to the device. (If a single backdoor key <em>a</em> was used for all devices, it could be recovered by a method similar to this <a href=\"/2012/03/20/factoring-multiple-rsa-keys/\">exercise</a>.) The device generates backdoored keys on request, then sends encrypted messages in the normal way. When some police agency wants to read an encrypted message, they request warrants from a judge, seize the device, determine the backdoor key <em>a</em>, and perform the procedure described above.</p>
