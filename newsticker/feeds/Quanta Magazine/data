(encoded nil "<p>This month’s <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151210-the-fabulously-fair-feast/\">Insights puzzle</a> featured a story about four finicky friends — Amar, Bob, Ching and Danica — who have rules to ensure that everyone enjoys their get-togethers and can bond with every other member of the group. At their get-togethers they have four “featured items” for the evening related to food, drink, activity or entertainment. The rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each person must like at least half of the featured items.</li>
<li>For exactly half of the items, each pair of friends must share either a like or dislike for those items.</li>
</ol>
<p>At a particular get-together planned by Amar, it is clear that Amar liked all four items, but Bob disliked the first one.</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you figure out the likes and dislikes of each friend? Write them out as a Sudoku square with the friends’ names alphabetically along the rows, and the items, in the order given, along the columns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Readers <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151210-the-fabulously-fair-feast/#comment-363151\">Michael DeLyser</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151210-the-fabulously-fair-feast/#comment-363474\">Ravi Kumar Meduri</a> both came up with this solution:</p>
<p>A            1     1     1     1<br />
B           -1   -1     1     1<br />
C            1    -1     1    -1<br />
D           -1     1     1    -1</p>
<p>where 1 represents likes and -1 represents dislikes.</p>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>Readers were asked to come up with the same kind of arrangement for eight people and eight items.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are several solutions. Michael gave a valid one. And Ravi gave a method for generalizing from the 4&#215;4 arrangement to an 8&#215;8 one:</p>
<p>The solution for eight can be generated from (a solution for) four as:</p>
<p>&nbsp;S4     S4</p>
<p>-S4     S4</p>
<p>Once again, half the columns in every two rows match, and half do not match.</p>
<p>&nbsp;1     1     1     1     1     1     1     1</p>
<p>-1   -1     1     1    -1   -1     1     1</p>
<p>&nbsp;1    -1     1    -1     1    -1     1   -1</p>
<p>-1     1     1   -1    -1     1     1   -1</p>
<p>-1   -1    -1   -1     1     1     1     1</p>
<p>&nbsp;1     1    -1   -1    -1   -1     1     1</p>
<p>-1    1    -1     1     1    -1     1     -1</p>
<p>&nbsp;1   -1    -1     1    -1     1     1   -1</p>
<p>We might ask an interesting follow-up question: How many different solutions are there to Question 2? I’ll leave it to readers to figure out the answer.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those of you who love word puzzles, here’s a treat for you:  The answers to this month’s puzzles are examples of mathematical structures that are known by a two-word name. The letters spelling out these two words are embedded in the text of today’s column. Can you find them?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is “Hadamard matrices,” which Ravi found in the sentences &#8220;<strong>Had Amar d</strong>ecided …&#8221; and &#8220;… sat around the <strong>mat</strong>, <strong>rice s</strong>oup …&#8221;</p>
<p><a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HadamardMatrix.html\">These matrices</a> have very interesting mathematical properties. If you consider each row as an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector (which matrices are often used for), then each row in a Hadamard matrix is orthogonal, or at right angles to each other. Thus the following 2&#215;2 Hadamard matrix (also called an “order 2” Hadamard matrix),</p>
<p>1     1</p>
<p>1    -1</p>
<div id=\"attachment_17483\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>represents the vectors (1,1) or a 45-degree line going up rightward and (1,-1) or a 45-degree line going up leftward, which are at right angles to each other. Another interesting property of Hadamard matrices is that if you multiply an order <em>n</em> Hadamard matrix by its transpose (the matrix you get when you swap its rows and columns), you get a specific diagonal matrix – one that has the number <em>n</em> repeated along its diagonal, with zeroes elsewhere. Mathematically, it is <em>n</em> times the identity matrix. So you can check whether your solution is correct by multiplying your matrix by its transpose at <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com\">Wolfram Alpha</a> (use braces) or an online <a href=\"http://matrix.reshish.com/multiplication.php\">matrix multiplication calculator</a>. You should get only 4s along the diagonal for question 1 and only 8s for question 2.</p>
<p>The Hadamard conjecture states that Hadamard matrices exist for any number <em>n</em> that is a multiple of 4. Mathematicians have consequently been trying to find Hadamard matrices for all multiples of 4, or find a multiple for which one does not exist. Some numbers have easy-to-find Hadamard matrices built from lower-order matrices (as we saw above when we derived a matrix of order 8 from a matrix of order 4); other numbers are not so easy to find, but mathematicians have been steadily finding them to push the unknown ones ever higher. In suggesting this topic, the mathematician Terence Tao remarked, “Apparently, the first open case of Hadamard’s conjecture is 668 — that is, it’s not known if there is a Hadamard matrix of order 668. I don&#8217;t recommend this as a puzzle for your magazine.”</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think the fabulous rug represents?</p></blockquote>
<p>The rug represents a possible arrangement that obeys the two rules mentioned, but not the specific instance asked for in Question 1. Here’s Michael, whose comment nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The carpet represents a simple solution for everyone’s likes and dislikes to satisfy the rules if we hadn’t been told that Amar liked everything. The squares with lines going from bottom left to top right are likes. The squares with lines going from top left to bottom right are dislikes. The top row is Amar, the second row is Bob, etc. The first column is the first featured item, the second column is the second item, etc. The rules are satisfied because each person likes three of the four items, and each pair shares a like for two of the items.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is another specific connection of the rug to Hadamard matrices. The rug is the artist’s rendition of a Hadamard matrix of order 428, which was the smallest unknown matrix order back in 2004. In June of that year, <a href=\"http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~hadi/\">Hadi Kharaghani</a> and <a href=\"http://math.ipm.ac.ir/tayfeh-r/\">Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie</a> built a Hadamard matrix of order 428. A beautiful rendition with two different colors for the 1s and -1s, using one pixel per matrix element, can be seen <a href=\"http://www.numericana.com/answer/matrix.htm\">on this site</a>. The drawing of the rug is based on this 428&#215;428 Hadamard matrix.</p>
<p>I hope I have succeeded in piquing your curiosity about these fascinating matrices and perhaps encouraged you to explore them further. The <em>Quanta</em> T-shirt for this month goes to Michael DeLyser, just edging Ravi Kumar Meduri. Congratulations!</p>
<p>That’s it for our Insights column for 2015. I hope to see you in 2016 with a whole year of new puzzles. Happy holidays and a happy new year to all!</p>

At a recent conference dedicated to the work, optimism mixed with bafflement.") (encoded nil "<p>Earlier this month the math world turned toward the University of Oxford, looking for signs of progress on a mystery that has gripped the community for three years.</p>
<p>The occasion was a conference on the work of <a href=\"http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/top-english.html\">Shinichi Mochizuki</a>, a brilliant mathematician at Kyoto University who in August 2012 released <a href=\"http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~motizuki/papers-english.html\">four papers</a> that were both difficult to understand and impossible to ignore. He called the work “inter-universal Teichmüller theory” (IUT theory) and explained that the papers contained a proof of the <em>abc</em> conjecture, one of the most spectacular unsolved problems in <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/number-theory/\">number theory</a>.</p>
<p>Within days it was clear that Mochizuki’s potential proof presented a virtually unprecedented challenge to the mathematical community. Mochizuki had developed IUT theory over a period of nearly 20 years, working in isolation. As a mathematician with a track record of solving hard problems and a reputation for careful attention to detail, he had to be taken seriously. Yet his papers were nearly impossible to read. The papers, which ran to more than 500 pages, were written in a novel formalism and contained many new terms and definitions. Compounding the difficulty, Mochizuki turned down all invitations to lecture on his work outside of Japan. Most mathematicians who attempted to read the papers got nowhere and soon abandoned the effort.</p>
<p>For three years, the theory languished. Finally, this year, during the week of December 7, some of the most prominent mathematicians in the world <a href=\"http://www.claymath.org/events/iut-theory-shinichi-mochizuki\">gathered at the Clay Mathematical Institute at Oxford</a> in the most significant attempt thus far to make sense of what Mochizuki had done. <a href=\"Minhyong%20Kim\">Minhyong Kim</a>, a mathematician at Oxford and one of the three organizers of the conference, explains that the attention was overdue.</p>
<p>“People are getting impatient, including me, including [Mochizuki], and it feels like certain people in the mathematical community have a responsibility to do something about this,” Kim said. “We do owe it to ourselves and, personally as a friend, I feel like I owe it to Mochizuki as well.”</p>
<p>The conference featured three days of preliminary lectures and two days of talks on IUT theory, including a culminating lecture on the fourth paper, where the proof of <em>abc</em> is said to arise. Few entered the week expecting to leave with a complete understanding of Mochizuki’s work or a clear verdict on the proof.  What they did hope to achieve was a sense of the strength of Mochizuki’s work. They wanted to be convinced that the proof contains powerful new ideas that would reward further exploration.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20350\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>For the first three days, those hopes only grew.</p>
<p><strong>A New Strategy</strong></p>
<p>The <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RkBl7WKzzRw\"><em>abc</em> conjecture</a> describes the relationship between the three numbers in perhaps the simplest possible equation: <em>a </em>+ <em>b</em> = <em>c</em>, for positive integers <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>. If those three numbers don’t have any factors in common apart from 1, then when the product of their distinct prime factors is raised to any fixed exponent larger than 1 (for example, exponent 1.001) the result is larger than <em>c</em> with only finitely many exceptions. (The number of exceptional triples <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em> violating this condition depends on the chosen exponent.)</p>
<p>The conjecture cuts deep into number theory because it posits an unexpected relationship between addition and multiplication. Given three numbers, there’s no obvious reason why the prime factors of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> would constrain the prime factors of <em>c</em>.</p>
<p>Until Mochizuki released his work, little progress had been made towards proving the <em>abc</em> conjecture since it was proposed in 1985. However, mathematicians understood early on that the conjecture was intertwined with other big problems in mathematics. For instance, a proof of the <em>abc</em> conjecture would improve on a landmark result in number theory. In 1983, <a href=\"https://www.hcm.uni-bonn.de/people/profile/gerd-faltings/\">Gerd Faltings</a>, now a director of the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, Germany, proved the Mordell conjecture, which asserts that there are only finitely many rational solutions to certain types of algebraic equations, an advance for which he won the Fields Medal in 1986. Several years later <a href=\"http://www.math.harvard.edu/~elkies/\">Noam Elkies</a> of Harvard University demonstrated that a proof of <em>abc</em> would make it possible to actually find those solutions.</p>
<p>“Faltings’ theorem was a great theorem, but it doesn’t give us any way to find the finite solutions,” Kim said, “so <em>abc</em>, if it’s proved in the right form, would give us a way to [improve] Faltings’ theorem.”</p>
<p>The <em>abc</em> conjecture is also equivalent to Szpiro’s conjecture, which was proposed by the French mathematician <a href=\"https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Mathematics/Faculty/Lucien-Szpiro/\">Lucien Szpiro</a> in the 1980s. Whereas the <em>abc</em> conjecture describes an underlying mathematical phenomenon in terms of relationships between integers, Szpiro’s conjecture casts that same underlying relationship in terms of elliptic curves, which give a geometric form to the set of all solutions to a type of algebraic equation.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20347\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>The translation from integers to elliptic curves is a common one in mathematics. It makes a conjecture more abstract and more complicated to state, but it also allows mathematicians to bring more techniques to bear on the problem. The strategy worked for <a href=\"https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/andrew.wiles\">Andrew Wiles</a> when he proved Fermat’s Last Theorem in 1994. Rather than working with the famously simple but constraining formulation of the problem (which states that there is no solution in positive integers to the equation <em>a<sup>n</sup></em> +<em>b<sup>n</sup></em> = <em>c<sup>n</sup></em> for any integer value of <em>n</em> greater than 2), he translated it twice over: once into a statement about elliptic curves and then into a statement about another type of mathematical object called “Galois representations” of elliptic curves. In the land of Galois representations, he was able to generate a proof that he could apply to the original statement of the problem.</p>
<p>Mochizuki employed a similar strategy in his work on <em>abc</em>. Rather than proving <em>abc</em> directly, he set out to prove Szpiro’s conjecture. And to do so, he first encoded all the relevant information from Szpiro’s conjecture in terms of a new class of mathematical objects of his own invention called Frobenioids.</p>
<p>Before Mochizuki began working on IUT theory, he spent a long time developing a different type of mathematics in pursuit of an <em>abc</em> proof. He called that line of thought “Hodge-Arakelov theory of elliptic curves.” It ultimately proved inadequate to the task. But in the process of creating it, he developed the idea of the Frobenioid, which is an algebraic structure extracted from a geometric object.</p>
<p>To understand how this works, consider a square with the corners labeled <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em> and <em>D</em>, with corner <em>A</em> in the lower right and corner <em>B</em> in the upper right. The square can be manipulated in a number of ways that preserve its physical location. For example, it can be rotated by 90 degrees counterclockwise, so that the arrangement of the labeled corners, starting from the lower right, ends up as (<em>D</em>, <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>C</em>). Or it can be rotated 180, 270 or 360 degrees, or flipped across either of its diagonals.</p>
<p>Each manipulation that preserves its physical location is called a symmetry of the square. All squares have eight such symmetries. To keep track of the different symmetries, mathematicians might impose an algebraic structure on the collection of all ways to label the corners. This structure is called a “group.” But as the group becomes freed from the geometric constraints of a square, it acquires new symmetries. No set of rigid motions will get you a square that can be labeled (<em>A</em>, <em>C</em>, <em>B</em>, <em>D</em>), since in the geometric square, <em>A</em> always has to be adjacent to <em>B</em>. Yet the labels in the group can be rearranged any way you want — 24 different ways in all.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20348\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Thus the algebraic group of the symmetries of the labels actually contains three times as much information as the geometric object that gave rise to it. For geometric objects more complicated than squares, such additional symmetries lead mathematicians to insights that are inaccessible if they use only the original geometry.</p>
<p>Frobenioids work in much the same way as the group described above. Instead of a square, they are an algebraic structure extracted from a special kind of elliptic curve. Just as in the example above, Frobenioids have symmetries beyond those arising from the original geometric object. Mochizuki expressed much of the data from Szpiro’s conjecture — which concerns elliptic curves — in terms of Frobenioids. Just as Wiles moved from Fermat’s Last Theorem to elliptic curves to Galois representations, Mochizuki worked his way from the <em>abc</em> conjecture to Szpiro’s conjecture to a problem involving Frobenioids, at which point he aimed to use the richer structure of Frobenioids to obtain a proof.</p>
<p>“From Mochizuki’s point of view, it’s all about looking for a more fundamental reality that lies behind the numbers,” Kim said. At each additional level of abstraction, previously hidden relationships come into view. “Many more things are related at an abstract level than they are at a concrete level,” he said.</p>
<p>In presentations at the end of the third day and first thing on the fourth day, <a href=\"http://math.ucsd.edu/~kedlaya/\">Kiran Kedlaya</a>, a number theorist at the University of California, San Diego, explained how Mochizuki intended to use Frobenioids in a proof of <em>abc</em>. His talks clarified a central concept in Mochizuki’s method and generated the most significant progress at the conference thus far. Faltings, who was Mochizuki’s doctoral adviser, wrote in an email that he found Kedlaya’s talks “inspiring.”</p>
<p>“Kedlaya’s talk was the mathematical high point of the meeting,” said <a href=\"http://math.stanford.edu/~conrad/\">Brian Conrad</a>, a number theorist at Stanford University who attended the conference. “I wrote to a lot of people on Wednesday evening to say, wow, this thing came up in Kedlaya’s talk, so on Thursday we’re probably going to see something very interesting.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t to be.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Good Confusion&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>The understanding that Mochizuki had recast <em>abc</em> in terms of Frobenioids was a surprising and intriguing development. By itself, though, it didn’t say much about what a final proof would look like.</p>
<p>Kedlaya’s exposition of Frobenioids had provided the assembled mathematicians with their first real sense of how Mochizuki’s techniques might circle back to the original formulation of Szpiro’s conjecture. The next step was the essential one — to show how the reformulation in terms of Frobenioids made it possible to bring genuinely new and powerful techniques to bear on a potential proof.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20351\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>These techniques appear in Mochizuki’s four IUT theory papers, which were the subject of the last two days of the conference. The job of explaining those papers fell to <a href=\"http://www.mcm.ac.cn/faculty/cpmok/201409/t20140916_255899.html\">Chung Pang Mok</a> of Purdue University and <a href=\"http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~yuichiro/index_e.html\">Yuichiro Hoshi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~gokun/\">Go Yamashita</a>, both colleagues of Mochizuki’s at the Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences at Kyoto University. The three are among a small handful of people who have devoted intense effort to understanding Mochizuki’s IUT theory. By all accounts, their talks were impossible to follow.</p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/voloch/\">Felipe Voloch</a>, a number theorist at the University of Texas, Austin, attended the conference and <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106680226131440966362/posts/49TR2Qeb9WR\">posted</a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106680226131440966362/posts/X9sNPQGfSVF\">updates</a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106680226131440966362/posts/LzSBw8zoG6w\">throughout</a> the <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106680226131440966362/posts/LLHPN3QLoqX\">five</a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/106680226131440966362/posts/UHoetkZ7XXK\">days</a> on the social-media site Google Plus. Like Conrad, he went into the Thursday talks anticipating a breakthrough — one that never came. Later that fourth day he wrote, “At the afternoon tea break, everybody was confused. I asked many people and nobody had a clue.” Conrad echoes that sentiment, explaining that the talks were a blizzard of technical terms.</p>
<p>“The reason it fell apart is not meant as a reflection of anything with Mochizuki,” he said. “I mean, far too much information was thrown at the audience in far too little time. I spoke with every participant there who was not previously involved in this work and we were all completely and totally lost.”</p>
<p>The failure of the final talks to communicate how Frobenioids are used in IUT theory was partly to be expected, according to some participants.</p>
<p>“I think there was some hope that we’d be able to follow the trail all the way through to the end, but frankly the material gets substantially more difficult at that point,” Kedlaya said. “It’s not entirely the fault of the speakers who came after me.”</p>
<p>Kim thinks the trouble with the final talks is due in part to cultural differences. Yamashita and Hoshi are both Japanese; Kim explains that in Japan, mathematicians are more accustomed to dealing with a steady succession of technical definitions in presentations. “That was one situation where cultural differences really did play something of a role,” Kim said. “Many dense slides requiring a good deal of patience and focus — that kind of thing is more acceptable in Japan. People are more used to a dialectic, interactive style when you go to a lecture in the U.S.”</p>

<p>While the conference did not yield an unequivocal outcome (as few people really expected it to do), it did produce real, if incremental, progress. Kedlaya said afterward that he felt motivated to correspond with others who have read more of IUT theory and that he planned to attend the next conference on the topic, in July at Kyoto University.</p>
<p>“I’m not unhappy with the amount of progress that was made,” Kedlaya said. “We wanted more, but I think it’s worth the effort of this community to take at least one more run at this and see if we can get further.”</p>
<p>Others think the onus remains on Mochizuki to better explain his work. “[I] got the impression that unless Mochizuki himself writes a readable paper, the matter will not be resolved,” Faltings said by email.</p>
<p>Kim is less certain that this step will be necessary. After everyone had left Oxford, he reflected on the confusion the attendees took home with them. As he saw it, it was good confusion, the kind that develops when you’re on your way to learning something.</p>
<p>“Prior to the workshop I would say most people who came generally had no idea of what the author was attempting in the IUT papers,” he said. “Last week people were still confused, but they had a pretty concrete outline of what the author was trying to do. How does he do it? That was a vague question. Now there are many more questions, but they’re much more sophisticated kinds of questions.”</p>

One hundred attendees had descended on a land with a celebrated tradition in both physics and the philosophy of science to wage what Ellis and Silk declared a “battle for the heart and soul of physics.”</p>
<p>The crisis, as Ellis and Silk tell it, is the wildly speculative nature of modern physics theories, which they say reflects a dangerous departure from the scientific method. Many of today’s theorists — chief among them the proponents of string theory and the multiverse hypothesis — appear convinced of their ideas on the grounds that they are beautiful or logically compelling, despite the impossibility of testing them. Ellis and Silk accused these theorists of “moving the goalposts” of science and blurring the line between physics and pseudoscience. “The imprimatur of science should be awarded only to a theory that is testable,” Ellis and Silk wrote, thereby disqualifying most of the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150803-physics-theories-map/\">leading theories of the past 40 years</a>. “Only then can we defend science from attack.”</p>
<p>They were reacting, in part, to the controversial ideas of <a href=\"http://homepage.univie.ac.at/richard.dawid/\">Richard Dawid</a>, an Austrian philosopher whose 2013 book <em>String Theory and the Scientific Method</em> identified three kinds of “non-empirical” evidence that Dawid says can help build trust in scientific theories absent empirical data. Dawid, a researcher at LMU Munich, answered Ellis and Silk’s battle cry and assembled far-flung scholars anchoring all sides of the argument for the high-profile event last week.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20269\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Gross, a supporter of string theory who won the 2004 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on the force that glues atoms together, kicked off the workshop by asserting that the problem lies not with physicists but with a “fact of nature” — one that we have been approaching inevitably for four centuries.</p>
<p>The dogged pursuit of a fundamental theory governing all forces of nature requires physicists to inspect the universe more and more closely — to examine, for instance, the atoms within matter, the protons and neutrons within those atoms, and the quarks within those protons and neutrons. But this zooming in demands evermore energy, and the difficulty and cost of building new machines increases exponentially relative to the energy requirement, Gross said. “It hasn’t been a problem so much for the last 400 years, where we’ve gone from centimeters to millionths of a millionth of a millionth of a centimeter” — the current resolving power of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland, he said. “We’ve gone very far, but this energy-squared is killing us.”</p>
<p>As we approach the practical limits of our ability to probe nature’s underlying principles, the minds of theorists have wandered far beyond the tiniest observable distances and highest possible energies. Strong clues indicate that the truly fundamental constituents of the universe lie at a distance scale 10 million billion times smaller than the resolving power of the LHC. This is the domain of nature that string theory, a candidate “theory of everything,” attempts to describe. But it’s a domain that no one has the faintest idea how to access.</p>
<p>The problem also hampers physicists’ quest to understand the universe on a cosmic scale: No telescope will ever manage to peer past our universe’s cosmic horizon and glimpse the other universes posited by the multiverse hypothesis. Yet modern theories of cosmology lead logically to the possibility that <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20141103-in-a-multiverse-what-are-the-odds/\">our universe is just one of many</a>.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20264\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Whether the fault lies with theorists for getting carried away, or with nature, for burying its best secrets, the conclusion is the same: Theory has detached itself from experiment. The objects of theoretical speculation are now too far away, too small, too energetic or too far in the past to reach or rule out with our earthly instruments. So, what is to be done? As Ellis and Silk wrote, “Physicists, philosophers and other scientists should hammer out a new narrative for the scientific method that can deal with the scope of modern physics.”</p>
<p>“The issue in confronting the next step,” said Gross, “is not one of ideology but strategy: What is the most useful way of doing science?”</p>
<p>Over three mild winter days, scholars grappled with the meaning of <em>theory</em>, <em>confirmation</em> and <em>truth</em>; how science works; and whether, in this day and age, philosophy should guide research in physics or the other way around. Over the course of these pressing yet timeless discussions, a degree of consensus took shape.</p>
<p><strong>Rules of the Game</strong></p>
<p>Throughout history, the rules of science have been written on the fly, only to be revised to fit evolving circumstances. The ancients believed they could reason their way toward scientific truth. Then, in the 17th century, Isaac Newton ignited modern science by breaking with this “rationalist” philosophy, adopting instead the “empiricist” view that scientific knowledge derives only from empirical observation. In other words, a theory must be proved experimentally to enter the book of knowledge.</p>
<p>But what requirements must an untested theory meet to be considered scientific? Theorists guide the scientific enterprise by dreaming up the ideas to be put to the test and then interpreting the experimental results; what keeps theorists within the bounds of science?</p>
<p>Today, most physicists judge the soundness of a theory by using the Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper’s rule of thumb. In the 1930s, Popper drew a line between science and nonscience in comparing the work of Albert Einstein with that of Sigmund Freud. Einstein’s theory of general relativity, which cast the force of gravity as curves in space and time, made risky predictions — ones that, if they hadn’t succeeded so brilliantly, would have failed miserably, falsifying the theory. But Freudian psychoanalysis was slippery: Any fault of your mother’s could be worked into your diagnosis. The theory wasn’t falsifiable, and so, Popper decided, it wasn’t science.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20270\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Critics accuse string theory and the multiverse hypothesis, as well as <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150612-in-theory-cosmic-inflation/\">cosmic inflation</a> — the leading theory of how the universe began — of falling on the wrong side of Popper’s line of demarcation. To borrow the title of the Columbia University physicist Peter Woit’s 2006 book on string theory, these ideas are “not even wrong,” say critics. In their editorial, Ellis and Silk invoked the spirit of Popper: “A theory must be falsifiable to be scientific.”</p>
<p>But, as many in Munich were surprised to learn, falsificationism is no longer the reigning philosophy of science. <a href=\"http://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Philosophy/Faculty-Bios/Massimo-Pigliucci\">Massimo Pigliucci</a>, a philosopher at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, pointed out that falsifiability is woefully inadequate as a separator of science and nonscience, as Popper himself recognized. Astrology, for instance, is falsifiable — indeed, it has been falsified <em>ad nauseam </em>— and yet it isn’t science. Physicists’ preoccupation with Popper “is really something that needs to stop,” Pigliucci said. “We need to talk about current philosophy of science. We don’t talk about something that was current 50 years ago.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, as several philosophers at the workshop said, Popperian falsificationism has been supplanted by Bayesian confirmation theory, or Bayesianism, a modern framework based on the 18th-century probability theory of the English statistician and minister Thomas Bayes. Bayesianism allows for the fact that modern scientific theories typically make claims far beyond what can be directly observed — no one has ever seen an atom — and so today’s theories often resist a falsified-unfalsified dichotomy. Instead, trust in a theory often falls somewhere along a continuum, sliding up or down between 0 and 100 percent as new information becomes available. “The Bayesian framework is much more flexible” than Popper’s theory, said <a href=\"http://stephanhartmann.org/\">Stephan Hartmann</a>, a Bayesian philosopher at LMU. “It also connects nicely to the psychology of reasoning.”</p>
<p>Gross concurred, saying that, upon learning about Bayesian confirmation theory from Dawid’s book, he felt “somewhat like the Molière character who said, ‘Oh my God, I’ve been talking prose all my life!’”</p>
<p>Another advantage of Bayesianism, Hartmann said, is that it is enabling philosophers like Dawid to figure out “how this non-empirical evidence fits in, or can be fit in.”</p>
<p><strong>Another Kind of Evidence</strong></p>
<p>Dawid, who is 49, mild-mannered and smiley with floppy brown hair, started his career as a theoretical physicist. In the late 1990s, during a stint at the University of California, Berkeley, a hub of string-theory research, Dawid became fascinated by how confident many string theorists seemed to be that they were on the right track, despite string theory’s complete lack of empirical support. “Why do they trust the theory?” he recalls wondering. “Do they have different ways of thinking about it than the canonical understanding?”</p>
<p>String theory says that elementary particles have dimensionality when viewed close-up, appearing as wiggling loops (or “strings”) and membranes at nature’s highest zoom level. According to the theory, extra dimensions also materialize in the fabric of space itself. The different vibrational modes of the strings in this higher-dimensional space give rise to the spectrum of particles that make up the observable world. In particular, one of the vibrational modes fits the profile of the “graviton” — the hypothetical particle associated with the force of gravity. Thus, string theory <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150508-what-happens-when-you-fall-into-a-black-hole/\">unifies gravity</a>, now described by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, with the rest of particle physics.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20278\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>However string theory, which has its roots in ideas developed in the late 1960s, has made no testable predictions about the observable universe. To understand why so many researchers trust it anyway, Dawid signed up for some classes in philosophy of science, and upon discovering how little study had been devoted to the phenomenon, he switched fields.</p>
<p>In the early 2000s, he identified three non-empirical arguments that generate trust in string theory among its proponents. First, there appears to be only one version of string theory capable of achieving unification in a consistent way (though it has many different mathematical representations); furthermore, no other “theory of everything” capable of unifying all the fundamental forces has been found, despite immense effort. (A rival approach called loop quantum gravity describes gravity at the quantum scale, but makes no attempt to unify it with the other forces.) This “no-alternatives” argument, colloquially known as “<a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150218-string-theory-only-game-in-town/\">string theory is the only game in town</a>,” boosts theorists’ confidence that few or no other possible unifications of the four fundamental forces exist, making it more likely that string theory is the right approach.</p>
<p>Second, string theory grew out of the Standard Model — the accepted, empirically validated theory incorporating all known fundamental particles and forces (apart from gravity) in a single mathematical structure — and the Standard Model also had no alternatives during its formative years. This “meta-inductive” argument, as Dawid calls it, buttresses the no-alternatives argument by showing that it has worked before in similar contexts, countering the possibility that physicists simply aren’t clever enough to find the alternatives that exist.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The third non-empirical argument is that string theory has unexpectedly delivered explanations for several other theoretical problems aside from the unification problem it was intended to address. The staunch string theorist <a href=\"http://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/joep/\">Joe Polchinski</a> of the University of California, Santa Barbara, presented several examples of these “unexpected explanatory interconnections,” as Dawid has termed them, in <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02477\">a paper</a> read in Munich in his absence. String theory explains the entropy of black holes, for example, and, in a surprising discovery that has caused a surge of research in the past 15 years, is <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20130701-signs-of-a-stranger-deeper-side-to-natures-building-blocks/\">mathematically translatable into a theory of particles</a>, such as the theory describing the nuclei of atoms.</p>
<p>Polchinski concludes that, considering how far away we are from the exceptionally fine grain of nature’s fundamental distance scale, we should count ourselves lucky: “String theory exists, and we have found it.” (Polchinski also used Dawid’s non-empirical arguments to calculate the Bayesian odds that the multiverse exists as 94 percent — a value that <a href=\"http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8149\">has been ridiculed</a> by the Internet’s vocal multiverse critics.)</p>
<p>One concern with including non-empirical arguments in Bayesian confirmation theory, Dawid acknowledged in his talk, is “that it opens the floodgates to abandoning all scientific principles.” One can come up with all kinds of non-empirical virtues when arguing in favor of a pet idea. “Clearly the risk is there, and clearly one has to be careful about this kind of reasoning,” Dawid said. “But acknowledging that non-empirical confirmation is part of science, and has been part of science for quite some time, provides a better basis for having that discussion than pretending that it wasn’t there, and only implicitly using it, and then saying I haven’t done it. Once it’s out in the open, one can discuss the pros and cons of those arguments within a specific context.”</p>
<p><strong>The Munich Debate</strong></p>
<p><div id=\"attachment_20267\" class=\"wp-caption The trash heap of history is littered with beautiful theories. The Danish historian of cosmology <a href=\"http://pure.au.dk/portal/en/persons/helge-kragh(2d1bdf37-f005-4eed-8eed-e0d2e4a863b1).html\">Helge Kragh</a>, who detailed a number of these failures in his 2011 book, <em>Higher Speculations</em>, spoke in Munich about the 19th-century vortex theory of atoms. This “Victorian theory of everything,” developed by the Scots Peter Tait and Lord Kelvin, postulated that atoms are microscopic vortexes in the ether, the fluid medium that was believed at the time to fill space. Hydrogen, oxygen and all other atoms were, deep down, just different types of vortical knots. At first, the theory “seemed to be highly promising,” Kragh said. “People were fascinated by the richness of the mathematics, which could keep mathematicians busy for centuries, as was said at the time.” Alas, atoms are not vortexes, the ether does not exist, and theoretical beauty is not always truth.</p>
<p>Except sometimes it is. Rationalism guided Einstein toward his theory of relativity, which he believed in wholeheartedly on rational grounds before it was ever tested. “I hold it true that pure thought can grasp reality, as the ancients dreamed,” Einstein said in 1933, years after his theory had been confirmed by observations of starlight bending around the sun.</p>
<p>The question for the philosophers is: Without experiments, is there any way to distinguish between the non-empirical virtues of vortex theory and those of Einstein’s theory? Can we ever really trust a theory on non-empirical grounds?</p>
<p>In discussions on the third afternoon of the workshop, the LMU philosopher Radin Dardashti asserted that Dawid’s philosophy specifically aims to pinpoint which non-empirical arguments should carry weight, allowing scientists to “make an assessment that is not based on simplicity, which is not based on beauty.” Dawidian assessment is meant to be more objective than these measures, Dardashti explained — and more revealing of a theory’s true promise.</p>
<p>Gross said Dawid has “described beautifully” the strategies physicists use “to gain confidence in a speculation, a new idea, a new theory.”</p>
<p>“You mean confidence that it’s true?” asked <a href=\"http://philosophy.jhu.edu/directory/peter-achinstein/\">Peter Achinstein</a>, an 80-year-old philosopher and historian of science at Johns Hopkins University. “Confidence that it’s useful? confidence that …”</p>
<p>“Let’s give an operational definition of confidence: I will continue to work on it,” Gross said.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty low,” Achinstein said.</p>
<p>“Not for science,” Gross said. “That’s the question that matters.”</p>
<p>Kragh pointed out that even Popper saw value in the kind of thinking that motivates string theorists today. Popper called speculation that did not yield testable predictions “metaphysics,” but he considered such activity worthwhile, since it might become testable in the future. This was true of atomic theory, which many 19th-century physicists feared would never be empirically confirmed. “Popper was not a naive Popperian,” Kragh said. “If a theory is not falsifiable,” Kragh said, channeling Popper, “it should not be given up. We have to wait.”</p>
<p>But several workshop participants raised qualms about Bayesian confirmation theory, and about Dawid’s non-empirical arguments in particular.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~rovelli/\">Carlo Rovelli</a>, a proponent of loop quantum gravity (string theory’s rival) who is based at Aix-Marseille University in France, objected that Bayesian confirmation theory does not allow for an important distinction that exists in science between theories that scientists are certain about and those that are still being tested. The Bayesian “confirmation” that atoms exist is essentially 100 percent, as a result of countless experiments. But Rovelli says that the degree of confirmation of atomic theory shouldn’t even be measured in the same units as that of string theory. String theory is not, say, 10 percent as confirmed as atomic theory; the two have different statuses entirely. “The problem with Dawid’s ‘non-empirical confirmation’ is that it muddles the point,” Rovelli said. “And of course some string theorists are happy of muddling it this way, because they can then say that string theory is ‘confirmed,’ equivocating.”</p>
<p>The German physicist <a href=\"http://www.nordita.org/people/index.php?variant=single&amp;u=sabineh\">Sabine Hossenfelder</a>, in her talk, argued that progress in fundamental physics very often comes from abandoning cherished prejudices (such as, perhaps, the assumption that the forces of nature must be unified). Echoing this point, Rovelli said “Dawid’s idea of non-empirical confirmation [forms] an obstacle to this possibility of progress, because it bases our credence on our own previous credences.” It “takes away one of the tools — maybe the soul itself — of scientific thinking,” he continued, “which is ‘do not trust your own thinking.’”</p>
<p>The Munich proceedings will be compiled and published, probably as a book, in 2017. As for what was accomplished, one important outcome, according to Ellis, was an acknowledgment by participating string theorists that the theory is not “confirmed” in the sense of being verified. “David Gross made his position clear: Dawid&#8217;s criteria are good for justifying working on the theory, not for saying the theory is validated in a non-empirical way,” Ellis wrote in an email. “That seems to me a good position — and explicitly stating that is progress.”</p>
<p>In considering how theorists should proceed, many attendees expressed the view that work on string theory and other as-yet-untestable ideas should continue. “Keep speculating,” Achinstein wrote in an email after the workshop, but “give your motivation for speculating, give your explanations, but admit that they are only possible explanations.”</p>
<p>“Maybe someday things will change,” Achinstein added, “and the speculations will become testable; and maybe not, maybe never.” We may never know for sure the way the universe works at all distances and all times, “but perhaps you can narrow the live possibilities to just a few,” he said. “I think that would be some progress.”</p>

(encoded nil "<p>A theoretical computer scientist has presented an algorithm that is being hailed as a breakthrough in mapping the obscure terrain of complexity theory, which explores how hard computational problems are to solve. Last month, <a href=\"http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~laci/\">László Babai</a>, of the University of Chicago, announced that he had come up with a new algorithm for the “graph isomorphism” problem, one of the most tantalizing mysteries in computer science. The new algorithm appears to be vastly more efficient than the previous best algorithm, which had held the record for more than 30 years. His <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03547v1\">paper became available today</a> on the scientific preprint site arxiv.org, and he has also submitted it to the Association for Computing Machinery’s <a href=\"http://acm-stoc.org/stoc2016/\">48th Symposium on Theory of Computing</a>.</p>
<p>For decades, the graph isomorphism problem has held a special status within complexity theory. While thousands of other computational problems have meekly succumbed to categorization as either hard or easy, graph isomorphism has defied classification. It seems easier than the hard problems, but harder than the easy problems, occupying a sort of no man’s land between these two domains. It is one of the two most famous problems in this strange gray area, said <a href=\"https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/1324\">Scott Aaronson</a>, a complexity theorist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Now, he said, “it looks as if one of the two may have fallen.”</p>
<p>Babai’s announcement has electrified the theoretical computer science community. If his work proves correct, it will be “one of the big results of the decade, if not the last several decades,” said <a href=\"http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~jgrochow/\">Joshua Grochow</a>, a computer scientist at the Santa Fe Institute.</p>
<p>Computer scientists use the word “graph” to refer to a network of nodes with edges connecting some of the nodes. The graph isomorphism question simply asks when two graphs are really the same graph in disguise because there’s a one-to-one correspondence (an “isomorphism”) between their nodes that preserves the ways the nodes are connected. The problem is easy to state, but tricky to solve, since even small graphs can be made to look very different just by moving their nodes around.</p>
<p>Now, Babai has taken what appears to be a major step forward in pinning down the problem’s difficulty level, by setting forth what he asserts is a “quasi-polynomial-time” algorithm to solve it. As Aaronson describes it, the algorithm places the problem within “the greater metropolitan area” of P, the class of problems that can be solved efficiently. While this new work is not the final word on how hard the graph isomorphism problem is, researchers see it as a game changer. “Before his announcement, I don’t think anyone, except maybe for him, thought this result was going to happen in the next 10 years, or perhaps even ever,” Grochow said.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_19797\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>In recent weeks, Babai gave four talks outlining his algorithm. It will take time for his new paper to be thoroughly vetted by other experts, however. Babai has declined to speak to the press, writing in an email: “The integrity of science requires that new results be subjected to thorough review by expert colleagues before the results are publicized in the media.”</p>
<p>Other researchers are cautiously hopeful that his proof will pan out. “Babai has a sterling record,” Aaronson said. “He’s as trustworthy as they come.”</p>
<p>“I think people are pretty optimistic,” said <a href=\"http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/\">Luca Trevisan</a>, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, after Babai’s second talk. Assuming the proof is correct, he said, “it’s a landmark result.”</p>
<p><strong>A Blind Taste Test</strong></p>
<p>Given two graphs, one way to check whether they are isomorphic is simply to consider every possible way to match up the nodes in one graph with the nodes in the other. But for graphs with <em>n</em> nodes, the number of different matchings is <em>n</em> factorial (1 * 2 * 3 * … * <em>n</em>), which is so much larger than <em>n</em> that this brute-force approach is hopelessly impractical for all but the smallest graphs. For graphs with just 10 nodes, for instance, there are already more than 3 million possible matchings to check. And for graphs with 100 nodes, the number of possible matchings far exceeds the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.</p>
<p>Computer scientists generally consider an algorithm to be efficient if its running time can be expressed not as a factorial but as a polynomial, such as <em>n</em><sup>2</sup> or <em>n</em><sup>3</sup>; polynomials grow much more slowly than factorials or exponential functions such as 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>. Problems that have a polynomial-time algorithm are said to be in the class P, and over the decades since this class was first proposed, thousands of natural problems in all areas of science and engineering have been shown to belong to it.</p>
<p>Computer scientists think of the problems in P as relatively easy, and they think of the thousands of problems in another category, “NP-complete,” as hard. No one has ever found an efficient algorithm for an NP-complete problem, and most computer scientists believe no one ever will. The question of whether the NP-complete problems are truly harder than the ones in P is the <a href=\"http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/millennium-prize-problems\">million-dollar</a> <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150929-edit-distance-computational-complexity/\">P versus NP problem</a>, widely regarded as one of the most important open questions in mathematics.</p>

It is one of only a tiny handful of natural problems that occupy this limbo; the only other such problem that’s as well-known as graph isomorphism is the problem of factoring a number into primes. “Lots of people have spent time working on graph isomorphism, because it’s a very natural, simple-to-state problem, but it’s also so mysterious,” Grochow said.</p>
<p>There are good reasons to suspect that graph isomorphism is not NP-complete. For example, it has a strange property that no NP-complete problem has ever been shown to have: It’s possible, in theory, for an all-knowing being (“Merlin”) to convince an ordinary person (“Arthur”) that two graphs are different without giving away any hints about where the differences lie.</p>
<p>This “zero-knowledge” proof is similar to the way Merlin could convince Arthur that Coke and Pepsi have different formulas even if Arthur can’t taste the difference between them. All Merlin would have to do is take repeated blind taste tests; if he can always correctly identify Coke and Pepsi, Arthur must accept that the two drinks are different.</p>
<p>Similarly, if Merlin told Arthur that two graphs are different, Arthur could test this assertion by putting the two graphs behind his back, moving their nodes around so that they looked very different from the way they started, and then showing them to Merlin and asking him which was which. If the two graphs are really isomorphic, there’s no way Merlin could tell. So if Merlin gets these questions right again and again, Arthur will eventually conclude that the two graphs must be different, even if he can’t spot the differences himself.</p>
<p>No one has ever found a blind-taste-test protocol for any NP-complete problem. For that and other reasons, there’s a fairly strong consensus among theoretical computer scientists that graph isomorphism is probably not NP-complete.</p>
<p>For the reverse question — whether graph isomorphism is in P — the evidence is more mixed. On the one hand, there are practical algorithms for graph isomorphism that can’t solve the problem efficiently for every single graph, but that do well on almost any graph you might throw at them, even randomly chosen ones. Computer scientists have to work hard to come up with graphs that trip these algorithms up.</p>
<p>On the other hand, graph isomorphism is what computer scientists call a “universal” problem: Every possible problem about whether two “combinatorial structures” are isomorphic — for example, the question of whether two different Sudoku puzzles are really the same underlying puzzle — can be recast as a graph isomorphism problem. This means that a fast algorithm for graph isomorphism would solve all these problems at once. “Usually when you have that kind of universality, it implies some kind of hardness,” Grochow said.</p>
<p>In 2012, <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/\">William Gasarch</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Maryland, College Park, <a href=\"https://www.cs.umd.edu/~gasarch/papers/poll2012.pdf\">informally polled</a> theoretical computer scientists about the graph isomorphism problem and found that 14 people believed it belongs to P, while six believed that it does not. Before Babai’s announcement, many people didn’t expect the problem to be resolved anytime soon. “I kind of thought maybe it was not in P, or maybe it was but we wouldn’t know in my lifetime,” Grochow said.</p>
<p><strong>Paint by Numbers</strong></p>
<p>Babai’s proposed algorithm doesn’t bring graph isomorphism all the way into P, but it comes close. It is quasi-polynomial, he asserts, which means that for a graph with <em>n</em> nodes, the algorithm’s running time is comparable to <em>n</em> raised not to a constant power (as in a polynomial) but to a power that grows very slowly.</p>
<p>The <a href=\"http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=808746\">previous best algorithm</a> — which Babai was also involved in creating in 1983 with Eugene Luks, now a professor emeritus at the University of Oregon — ran in “subexponential” time, a running time whose distance from quasi-polynomial time is nearly as big as the gulf between exponential time and polynomial time. Babai, who started working on graph isomorphism in 1977, “has been chipping away at this problem for about 40 years,” Aaronson said.</p>
<p>Babai’s new algorithm starts by taking a small set of nodes in the first graph and virtually “painting” each one a different color. Then it begins to look for an isomorphism by making an initial guess about which nodes in the second graph might correspond to these nodes, and it paints those nodes the same colors as their corresponding nodes in the first graph. The algorithm eventually cycles through all possible guesses.</p>
<p>Once the initial guess has been made, it constrains what other nodes may do: For example, a node that is connected to the blue node in the first graph must correspond to a node that is connected to the blue node in the second graph. To keep track of these constraints, the algorithm introduces new colors: It might paint nodes yellow if they are linked to a blue node and a red node, or green if they are connected to a red node and two yellow nodes, and so on. The algorithm keeps introducing more colors until there are no connectivity features left to capture.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_19795\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Once the graphs are colored, the algorithm can rule out all matchings that pair nodes of different colors. If the algorithm is lucky, the painting process will divide the graphs into many chunks of different colors, greatly reducing the number of possible isomorphisms the algorithm has to consider. If, instead, most of the nodes end up the same color, Babai has developed a different way to reduce the number of possible isomorphisms, which works except in one case: when the two graphs contain a structure related to a “Johnson graph.” These are graphs that have so much symmetry that the painting process and Babai’s further refinements just don’t give enough information to guide the algorithm.</p>
<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5ovzZJ8vI8\">first of several talks on his new algorithm</a>, on November 10, Babai called these Johnson graphs “a source of just unspeakable misery” to computer scientists working on painting schemes for the graph isomorphism problem. But Johnson graphs can be handled fairly easily by other methods, so by showing that these graphs are the only obstacle to his painting scheme, Babai was able to tame them.</p>
<p>Babai’s approach is “a very natural strategy, very clean in some sense,” said <a href=\"http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~simon/\">Janos Simon</a>, a computer scientist at the University of Chicago. “It’s very likely that it’s the correct one, but all mathematicians are cautious.”</p>
<p>Even though the new algorithm has moved graph isomorphism much closer to P than ever before, Babai speculated in his first talk that the problem may lie just outside its borders, in the suburbs rather than the city center. That would be the most interesting possibility, Trevisan said, since it would make graph isomorphism the first natural problem to have a quasi-polynomial algorithm but no polynomial algorithm. “It would show that the landscape of complexity theory is much richer than we thought,” he said. If this is indeed the case, however, don’t expect a proof anytime soon: Proving it would amount to solving the P versus NP problem, since it would mean that graph isomorphism separates the problems in P from the NP-complete problems.</p>
<p>Many computer scientists believe, instead, that graph isomorphism is now on a glide path that will eventually send it coasting into P. That is the usual trajectory, Trevisan said, once a quasi-polynomial algorithm has been found. Then again, “somehow this problem has surprised people many times,” he said. “Maybe there’s one more surprise coming.”</p>

(encoded nil "<p>This month’s Insights puzzle arises out of a peculiar weekly bonding ritual of four fair-minded friends. Amar, Bob, Ching and Danica are math graduate students who share a house. Their living room has a fabulous rug that they call the “magic carpet,” shown above, around which they gather every weekend for a feast. The four have strong likes and dislikes, so they have instituted rules to ensure that everyone enjoys the get-togethers and can bond with each other member of the group. At every feast they have four “featured items” for the evening related to food, drink, activity or entertainment. The rules are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each person must like at least half of the featured items.</li>
<li>For exactly half of the items, each pair of friends must share either a like or dislike for those items.</li>
</ol>
<div id=\"attachment_17483\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>As Bob entered the living room for a recent get-together, he wondered what the items would be. They were going to have a rice entrée, ice cream for dessert, followed by coffee and a game of Sudoku. “Had Amar decided the items for today?” Bob wondered. “It had to be him: He likes all this stuff.” As he took his place around the mat, rice soup in hand, Bob thought, “I guess I can suffer rice for an evening.” After all, it was mathematically guaranteed to be a pleasant evening, as Amar had followed the rules. Each one of them had at least two items that they liked. Each pair of friends had a couple of items for which their like or dislike coincided and over which they could enthuse or commiserate. The pairwise bonding situation was neat and balanced. Just like Sudoku.</p>
<p>Question 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you figure out the likes and dislikes of each friend? Write them out as a Sudoku square with the friends’ names alphabetically along the rows, and the items, in the order given, along the columns. (<strong>Update:</strong> The solution is now <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151222-solution-the-fabulously-fair-feast/\">available here</a>.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Question 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>On a special occasion, the four friends decided to invite two of their colleagues from next door, Emma and Fred. But try as they might, they found they could not find a way to make their rules fit six people. They soon realized, however, that if they invited two more friends, Gary and Hannah, they could make things work in exactly the same way. The eight of them had a great evening, adding jazz, pizza, movie talk and liqueur to their four previous items. At this grand get-together, each pair of people had some items for which their likes or dislikes coincided and the total number of such items was exactly four. Can you make a Sudoku square for this situation, as you did for Question 1?</p></blockquote>
<p>This puzzle was suggested by the mathematician Terence Tao, who was featured in Erica Klarreich’s article <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20151001-tao-erdos-discrepancy-problem/\"><em>A Magical Answer to an 80-Year-Old Puzzle</em></a>.

<p>We might ask an interesting follow-up question: How many different solutions are there to Question 2? I’ll leave it to readers to figure out the answer.</p>
<p>Question 3:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those of you who love word puzzles, here’s a treat for you:  The answers to this month’s puzzles are examples of mathematical structures that are known by a two-word name. The letters spelling out these two words are embedded in the text of today’s column. Can you find them?</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer is “Hadamard matrices,” which Ravi found in the sentences “<strong>Had Amar d</strong>ecided …” and “… sat around the <strong>mat</strong>, <strong>rice s</strong>oup …”</p>
<p><a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HadamardMatrix.html\">These matrices</a> have very interesting mathematical properties. If you consider each row as an <em>n</em>-dimensional vector (which matrices are often used for), then each row in a Hadamard matrix is orthogonal, or at right angles to each other. Thus the following 2×2 Hadamard matrix (also called an “order 2” Hadamard matrix),</p>
<p>1     1</p>
<p>1    -1</p>
<div id=\"attachment_17483\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>represents the vectors (1,1) or a 45-degree line going up rightward and (1,-1) or a 45-degree line going up leftward, which are at right angles to each other. Another interesting property of Hadamard matrices is that if you multiply an order <em>n</em> Hadamard matrix by its transpose (the matrix you get when you swap its rows and columns), you get a specific diagonal matrix – one that has the number <em>n</em> repeated along its diagonal, with zeroes elsewhere. Mathematically, it is <em>n</em> times the identity matrix. So you can check whether your solution is correct by multiplying your matrix by its transpose at <a href=\"http://www.wolframalpha.com\">Wolfram Alpha</a> (use braces) or an online <a href=\"http://matrix.reshish.com/multiplication.php\">matrix multiplication calculator</a>. You should get only 4s along the diagonal for question 1 and only 8s for question 2.</p>
<p>The Hadamard conjecture states that Hadamard matrices exist for any number <em>n</em> that is a multiple of 4. Mathematicians have consequently been trying to find Hadamard matrices for all multiples of 4, or find a multiple for which one does not exist. Some numbers have easy-to-find Hadamard matrices built from lower-order matrices (as we saw above when we derived a matrix of order 8 from a matrix of order 4); other numbers are not so easy to find, but mathematicians have been steadily finding them to push the unknown ones ever higher. In suggesting this topic, the mathematician Terence Tao remarked, “Apparently, the first open case of Hadamard’s conjecture is 668 — that is, it’s not known if there is a Hadamard matrix of order 668. I don’t recommend this as a puzzle for your magazine.”</p>
<p>Question 4:</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you think the fabulous rug represents?</p></blockquote>
<p>The rug represents a possible arrangement that obeys the two rules mentioned, but not the specific instance asked for in Question 1. Here’s Michael, whose comment nails it:</p>
<blockquote><p>The carpet represents a simple solution for everyone’s likes and dislikes to satisfy the rules if we hadn’t been told that Amar liked everything. The squares with lines going from bottom left to top right are likes. The squares with lines going from top left to bottom right are dislikes. The top row is Amar, the second row is Bob, etc. The first column is the first featured item, the second column is the second item, etc. The rules are satisfied because each person likes three of the four items, and each pair shares a like for two of the items.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is another specific connection of the rug to Hadamard matrices. The rug is the artist’s rendition of a Hadamard matrix of order 428, which was the smallest unknown matrix order back in 2004. In June of that year, <a href=\"http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~hadi/\">Hadi Kharaghani</a> and <a href=\"http://math.ipm.ac.ir/tayfeh-r/\">Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie</a> built a Hadamard matrix of order 428. A beautiful rendition with two different colors for the 1s and -1s, using one pixel per matrix element, can be seen <a href=\"http://www.numericana.com/answer/matrix.htm\">on this site</a>. The drawing of the rug is based on this 428×428 Hadamard matrix.</p>

The squares with lines going from bottom left to top right are likes. The squares with lines going from top left to bottom right are dislikes. The top row is Amar, the second row is Bob, etc. The first column is the first featured item, the second column is the second item, etc. The rules are satisfied because each person likes three of the four items, and each pair shares a like for two of the items.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is another specific connection of the rug to Hadamard matrices. The rug is the artist’s rendition of a Hadamard matrix of order 428, which was the smallest unknown matrix order back in 2004. In June of that year, <a href=\"http://www.cs.uleth.ca/~hadi/\">Hadi Kharaghani</a> and <a href=\"http://math.ipm.ac.ir/tayfeh-r/\">Behruz Tayfeh-Rezaie</a> built a Hadamard matrix of order 428. A beautiful rendition with two different colors for the 1s and -1s, using one pixel per matrix element, can be seen <a href=\"http://www.numericana.com/answer/matrix.htm\">on this site</a>. The drawing of the rug is based on this 428&#215;428 Hadamard matrix.</p>
<p>I hope I have succeeded in piquing your curiosity about these fascinating matrices and perhaps encouraged you to explore them further. The <em>Quanta</em> T-shirt for this month goes to Michael DeLyser, just edging Ravi Kumar Meduri. Congratulations!</p>

But the molecule rarely takes that form in living cells. Instead, double-helix DNA is further <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150225-genetic-geometry-takes-shape/\">wrapped into complex shapes</a> that can play a profound role in how it interacts with other molecules. “DNA is way more active in its own regulation than we thought,” said <a href=\"https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs/lynn-zechiedrich/\">Lynn Zechiedrich</a>, a biophysicist at Baylor College of Medicine and one of the researchers leading the study of so-called supercoiled DNA. “It’s not a passive [molecule] waiting to be latched on to by proteins.”</p>
<p>Zechiedrich’s newest findings, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151012/ncomms9440/full/ncomms9440.html\">published</a> in <em>Nature Communications </em>in October, capture the dynamic nature of supercoiled DNA and point to what could be a new solution to one of DNA’s longstanding puzzles. <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150710-genetic-alphabet/\">The letters of the genetic code</a>, known as bases, lie hidden within the helix — so how does the molecular machinery that reads that code and replicates DNA get access? Specialized proteins can unzip small segments of the molecule when it’s replicated and when it’s converted into RNA, a process known as transcription. But Zechiedrich’s work illustrates how DNA opens on its own. Simply twisting DNA can expose internal bases to the outside, without the aid of any proteins. Additional work by <a href=\"https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Pathology/david-l-levens\">David Levens</a>, a biologist at the National Cancer Institute, has shown that transcription itself contorts DNA in living human cells, tightening some parts of the coil and loosening it in others. That stress triggers changes in shape, most notably opening up the helix to be read.</p>
<p>The research hints at an unstudied language of DNA topology that could direct a host of cellular processes. “It’s intriguing that DNA behaves this way, that topology matters in living organisms,” said <a href=\"http://benham.genomecenter.ucdavis.edu/\">Craig Benham</a>, a mathematical biologist at the University of California, Davis. “I think that was a surprise to many biologists.”</p>
<p><strong>No Time to Relax</strong></p>
<p>To get a sense for supercoiled DNA, imagine twisting a piece of string. Let the string go, and it unwinds. Twist it enough, and it folds back on itself. The degree of twist puts stress on the string, which governs the shape it takes.</p>
<p>DNA behaves in a similar fashion. Like the string, it prefers to be in its most relaxed state — the iconic double helix. But DNA rarely gets to relax. It’s subject to a continual onslaught of molecules that bind it — the enzymes that untangle, unwind and then replicate DNA; the molecules that mark which genes are active and which are silent; and the proteins that pack the lengthy molecule into a manageable size. All of these molecules contort DNA into new shapes, blocking it from the repose of the simple double helix.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20433\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>These interactions represent the inner workings of the cell, the basis of all life. How the cell decides to activate a certain gene, for example, involves a complex assembly of molecules in the right place at the right time. Protein-DNA interactions also present prime targets for drugs as well as insights into disease. Imagine a drug that could block activation of a cancer-linked gene without interfering with other genes.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these interactions are very difficult to study because biological molecules morph shapes so easily. A mechanic would have a hard time fixing a car if the parts constantly mutated.</p>
<p>To capture the complex structure of these nanoscale interactions, scientists typically crystalize the molecules, freezing their shape for the camera. The vast majority of these studies use short strands of relaxed DNA — the standard double-helix form — because they’re easy to work with and cheap to make. But that may not capture the true picture; relaxed DNA often behaves differently than that found in the cell, contorted around all manner of proteins.</p>
<p>Zechiedrich and her collaborators have spent the last two decades making small pieces of supercoiled DNA, whose behavior better mimics DNA in the living cell. Essentially, they take a short strand of DNA and twist it — once, twice, three times or more — either with or against the coil. Then they glue the ends together. The end result is a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151012/ncomms9440/full/ncomms9440.html\">tiny circle of DNA</a> coiled in one direction or another. Zechiedrich, her collaborator and Baylor colleague <a href=\"https://www.bcm.edu/people/view/b17b6e78-ffed-11e2-be68-080027880ca6\">Jonathan Fogg</a> and others have shown that these twisted coils dance, shimmying through a microscopic ballet. Each molecule can assume a variety of shapes, from simple circles to figure eights, racquets, handcuffs, needles and rods. “Linear DNA is stiff and inflexible,” said <a href=\"http://www.math.fsu.edu/~sumners/\">De Witt Sumners</a>, a mathematician at Florida State University in Tallahassee. “But when you get it bent into a small circle, the duplex opens up and adopts a large number of interesting shapes — this is completely unexpected.”</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20434\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>The newest study from Zechiedrich’s lab provides the clearest picture yet of these tiny rings. The researchers captured microscopic images of individual circlets in a variety of diverse shapes. Pairing the images with sophisticated computational models created by collaborator <a href=\"http://www.astbury.leeds.ac.uk/people/staff/staffpage.php?StaffID=SAH\">Sarah Harris</a>, a biologist at the University of Leeds, they were able to predict the precise movements of each molecule.</p>
<p>Though scientists already knew bits and pieces of how supercoiled DNA functions, the combination of microscopy and modeling in the new paper helps to create a more precise picture. “For a large part of the biological community, seeing is believing,” said <a href=\"http://www.utdallas.edu/biology/faculty/research/levene.html\">Stephen Levene</a>, a biophysicist and bioengineer at the University of Texas, Dallas, who was not involved in the study. “You can show math models, but unless you have some convincing structural data, it’s hard to get people to appreciate what’s going on.”</p>

<p>But soon after that work was done, scientists developed new techniques to read the sequence of the base letters in the genome, launching the genetic sequencing revolution. “Sequencing opened up a lot of possibilities, but it also sidetracked everyone, so that [structural] questions were suddenly very passé,” said Benham.</p>
<p>For three decades, most scientists assumed that supercoiling probably wasn’t very important in complex cells, which have special enzymes that snip and untangle knotted DNA. These enzymes help prevent the buildup of troublesome stress. But they aren’t 100 percent effective. In 2008, Levens, the National Cancer Institute biologist, led a team that detected supercoils in human cells, reigniting interest in DNA’s higher-order structure.</p>
<p>Levens and collaborators found that transcription twists DNA, leaving a trail of undercoiled (or negatively supercoiled) DNA in its wake. Moreover, they discovered that the DNA sequence itself effects how the molecule responds to supercoiling. For example, the researchers identified a specific sequence of DNA that’s prone to opening when stressed, like a weak spot in an old inner tube. The segment acts as a sort of chemical cruise control; as the amount of supercoil rises and falls, it slows or speeds the pace at which molecular machinery reads DNA.</p>
<p>Levens says these structural changes also help DNA communicate along its length. Just as pressing an inner tube makes a weak spot bulge, changes in the shape of one part of the DNA molecule might trigger stress elsewhere along its length, which in turn might help regulate genes.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20454\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>The findings align with Harris’s models, which show that supercoiling can split the two strands of the helix, rotating the DNA bases that normally lie inside the helix to the outside, a phenomenon known as base flipping. Other simulations show that twisting a bit more flips out additional bases, creating a bubble of inside-out DNA. Zechiedrich theorizes these bubbles might provide trigger points for replication or gene expression. This challenges the standard view, in which proteins latch onto DNA and launch these events. “Who’s driving the bus in cellular metabolism?” said Sumners. “It’s a very dynamic process — DNA and proteins each influences how the other acts and reacts.”</p>

<p>Few facts of experience are as obvious and pervasive as the distinction between past and future. We remember one, but anticipate the other. If you run a movie backwards, it doesn’t look realistic. We say there is an <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140416-times-arrow-traced-to-quantum-source/\">arrow of time</a>, which points from past to future.</p>
<p>One might expect that a fact as basic as the existence of time’s arrow would be embedded in the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150803-physics-theories-map/\">fundamental laws of physics</a>. But the opposite is true. If you could take a movie of subatomic events, you’d find that the backward-in-time version looks perfectly reasonable. Or, put more precisely: The fundamental laws of physics — up to some tiny, esoteric exceptions, as we’ll soon discuss — will look to be obeyed, whether we follow the flow of time forward or backward. In the fundamental laws, time’s arrow is reversible.</p>
<blockquote class=\"simple_aside\">
<h3><strong>Quantized</strong></h3>
<p><em>A <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/tag/quantized/\" target=\"_blank\">monthly column</a> in which top researchers explore the process of discovery. This month’s columnist, Frank Wilczek, is a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Logically speaking, the transformation that reverses the direction of time might have changed the fundamental laws. Common sense would suggest that it should. But it does not. Physicists use convenient shorthand — also called jargon — to describe that fact. They call the transformation that reverses the arrow of time “time reversal,” or simply T. And they refer to the (approximate) fact that T does not change the fundamental laws as “T invariance,” or “T symmetry.”</p>
<p>Everyday experience violates T invariance, while the fundamental laws respect it. That blatant mismatch raises challenging questions. <em>How</em> does the actual world, whose <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150813-how-does-symmetry-shape-natures-laws/\">fundamental laws respect T symmetry</a>, manage to look so asymmetric? Is it possible that someday we’ll encounter beings with the opposite flow — beings who grow younger as we grow older? Might we, through some physical process, turn around our own body’s arrow of time?</p>
<div id=\"attachment_18094\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>Those are great questions, and I hope to write about them in a <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">past</span> future posting. Here, however, I want to consider a complementary question. It arises when we start from the other end, in the facts of common experience. From that perspective, the puzzle is this:</p>
<p><em>Why should the fundamental laws have that bizarre and problem-posing property, T invariance? </em></p>
<p>The answer we can offer today is incomparably deeper and more sophisticated than that we could offer 50 years ago. Today’s understanding emerged from a brilliant interplay of experimental discovery and theoretical analysis, which yielded several Nobel prizes. Yet our answer still contains a serious loophole. As I’ll explain, closing that loophole may well lead us, as an unexpected bonus, to identify the cosmological “<a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150820-the-case-for-complex-dark-matter/\">dark matter</a>.”</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\">II.</p>
<p>The modern history of T invariance begins in 1956. In that year, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/\">T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang</a> <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.104.254\">questioned a different but related feature of physical law</a>, which until then had been taken for granted. Lee and Yang were not concerned with T itself, but with its spatial analogue, the parity transformation, “P.” Whereas T involves looking at movies run backward in time, P involves looking at movies reflected in a mirror. Parity invariance is the hypothesis that the events you see in the reflected movies follow the same laws as the originals. Lee and Yang identified circumstantial evidence against that hypothesis and suggested critical experiments to test it. Within a few months, experiments proved that P invariance fails in many circumstances. (P invariance holds for gravitational, electromagnetic and strong interactions, but generally fails in the so-called weak interactions.)</p>
<p>Those dramatic developments around P (non)invariance stimulated physicists to question T invariance, a kindred assumption they had also once taken for granted. But the hypothesis of T invariance survived close scrutiny for several years. It was only in 1964 that a group led by <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1980/\">James Cronin and Valentine Fitch</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.138\">discovered a peculiar, tiny effect in the decays of K mesons</a> that violates T invariance.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\">III.</p>
<p>The wisdom of Joni Mitchell’s insight — that “you don’t know what you’ve got ‘til it’s gone” — was proven in the aftermath.</p>
<p>If, like small children, we keep asking, “Why?” we may get deeper answers for a while, but eventually we will hit bottom, when we arrive at a truth that we can’t explain in terms of anything simpler. At that point we must call a halt, in effect declaring victory: “That’s just the way it is.” But if we later find exceptions to our supposed truth, that answer will no longer do. We will have to keep going.</p>
<p>As long as T invariance appeared to be a universal truth, it wasn’t clear that our italicized question was a useful one. Why was the universe T invariant? It just was. But after Cronin and Fitch, the mystery of T invariance could not be avoided.</p>
<p>Many theoretical physicists struggled with the vexing challenge of understanding how T invariance could be extremely accurate, yet not quite exact. Here the work of <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/\">Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa</a> proved decisive. In 1973, they <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1143/PTP.49.652\">proposed</a> that approximate T invariance is an accidental consequence of other, more-profound principles.</p>
<p>The time was ripe. Not long before, the outlines of the modern Standard Model of particle physics had emerged and with it a new level of clarity about fundamental interactions. By 1973 there was a powerful — and empirically successful! — theoretical framework, based on a few “sacred principles.” Those principles are relativity, quantum mechanics and a mathematical rule of uniformity called “gauge symmetry.”</p>
<p>It turns out to be quite challenging to get all those ideas to cooperate. Together, they greatly constrain the possibilities for basic interactions.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_18496\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>Kobayashi and Maskawa, in a few brief paragraphs, did two things. First they showed that if physics were restricted to the particles then known (for experts: if there were just two families of quarks and leptons), then all the interactions allowed by the sacred principles also respect T invariance. If Cronin and Fitch had never made their discovery, that result would have been an unalloyed triumph. But they had, so Kobayashi and Maskawa went a crucial step further. They showed that if one introduces a very specific set of new particles (a third family), then those particles bring in new interactions that lead to a tiny violation of T invariance. It looked, on the face of it, to be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>In subsequent years, their brilliant piece of theoretical detective work was fully vindicated. The new particles whose existence Kobayashi and Maskawa inferred have all been observed, and their interactions are just what Kobayashi and Maskawa proposed they should be.</p>
<p>Before ending this section, I’d like to add a philosophical coda. Are the sacred principles really sacred? Of course not. If experiments force scientists to modify those principles, they will do so. But at the moment, the sacred principles look awfully good. And evidently it’s been fruitful to take them very seriously indeed.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\">IV.</p>
<p>So far I’ve told a story of triumph. Our italicized question, one of the most striking puzzles about how the world works, has received an answer that is deep, beautiful and fruitful.</p>
<p>But there’s a worm in the rose.</p>
<p>A few years after Kobayashi and Maskawa’s work, <a href=\"http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/\">Gerard ’t Hooft</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.37.8\">discovered a loophole</a> in their explanation of T invariance. The sacred principles allow an additional kind of interaction. The possible new interaction is quite subtle, and ’t Hooft’s discovery was a big surprise to most theoretical physicists.</p>
<p>The new interaction, were it present with substantial strength, would violate T invariance in ways that are much more obvious than the effect that Cronin, Fitch and their colleagues discovered. Specifically, it would allow the spin of a neutron to generate an electric field, in addition to the magnetic field it is observed to cause. (The magnetic field of a spinning neutron is broadly analogous to that of our rotating Earth, though of course on an entirely different scale.) Experimenters have looked hard for such electric fields, but so far they’ve come up empty.</p>
<p>Nature does not choose to exploit ’t Hooft’s loophole. That is her prerogative, of course, but it raises our italicized question anew: <em>Why does Nature enforce T invariance so accurately? </em></p>
<p>Several explanations have been put forward, but only one has stood the test of time. The central idea is due to <a href=\"http://www.pa.ucla.edu/directory/roberto-peccei\">Roberto Peccei</a> and <a href=\"https://www.aip.org/news/2015/helen-quinn-named-winner-2016-aip-karl-compton-medal\">Helen Quinn</a>. <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/248549883_CP_Conservation_in_the_Presence_of_Pseudoparticles\">Their proposal</a>, like that of Kobayashi and Maskawa, involves expanding the standard model in a fairly specific way. One introduces a neutralizing field, whose behavior is especially sensitive to ’t Hooft’s new interaction. Indeed if that new interaction is present, then the neutralizing field will adjust its own value, so as to cancel that interaction’s influence. (This adjustment process is broadly similar to how negatively charged electrons in a solid will congregate around a positively charged impurity and thereby screen its influence.) The neutralizing field thereby closes our loophole.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_20476\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>Peccei and Quinn overlooked an important, testable consequence of their idea. The particles produced by their neutralizing field — its quanta<em> — </em>are predicted to have remarkable properties. Since they didn’t take note of these particles, they also didn’t name them. That gave me an opportunity to fulfill a dream of my adolescence.</p>
<p>A few years before, a supermarket display of brightly colored boxes of a laundry detergent named Axion had caught my eye. It occurred to me that “axion” sounded like the name of a particle and really ought to be one. So <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.40.279\">when I noticed a new particle that “cleaned up” a problem with an “axial” current</a>, I saw my chance. (I soon learned that <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150317-sciences-path-from-myth-to-multiverse/\">Steven Weinberg</a> had also <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.40.223\">noticed this particle</a>, independently. He had been calling it the “Higglet.” He graciously, and I think wisely, agreed to abandon that name.) Thus began <a href=\"http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/reviews/rpp2014-rev-axions.pdf\">a saga</a> whose conclusion remains to be written.</p>
<p>In the chronicles of the <a href=\"http://pdg.lbl.gov/\">Particle Data Group</a> you will find <a href=\"http://pdg.lbl.gov/2015/listings/rpp2015-list-axions.pdf\">several pages</a>, covering dozens of experiments, describing unsuccessful axion searches.</p>
<p>Yet there are grounds for optimism.</p>
<p>The theory of axions predicts, in a general way, that axions should be very light, very long-lived particles whose interactions with ordinary matter are very feeble. But to compare theory and experiment we need to be quantitative. And here we meet ambiguity, because existing theory does not fix the value of the axion’s mass. If we know the axion’s mass we can predict all its other properties. But the mass itself can vary over a wide range. (The same basic problem arose for the charmed quark, the Higgs particle, the top quark and several other others. Before each of those particles was discovered, theory predicted all of its properties <em>except</em> for the value of its mass.) It turns out that the strength of the axion’s interactions is proportional to its mass. So as the assumed value for axion mass decreases, the axion becomes more elusive.</p>
<p>In the early days physicists focused on models in which the axion is closely related to the Higgs particle. Those ideas suggested that the axion mass should be about 10 keV — that is, about one-fiftieth of an electron’s mass. Most of the experiments I alluded to earlier searched for axions of that character. By now we can be confident such axions don’t exist.</p>
<p>Attention turned, therefore, toward much smaller values of the axion mass (and in consequence feebler couplings), which are not excluded by experiment. Axions of this sort arise very naturally in models that unify the interactions of the standard model. They also arise in string theory.</p>

<p>Axions, we calculate, should have been abundantly produced during the earliest moments of the Big Bang. If axions exist at all, then an axion fluid will pervade the universe. The origin of the axion fluid is very roughly similar to the origin of the famous cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, but there are three major differences between those two entities. First: The microwave background has been observed, while the axion fluid is still hypothetical. Second: Because axions have mass, their fluid contributes significantly to the overall mass density of the universe. In fact, we calculate that they contribute roughly the amount of mass astronomers have identified as dark matter! Third: Because axions interact so feebly, they are much more difficult to observe than photons from the CMB.</p>
<p>The experimental search for axions continues on several fronts. Two of the most promising experiments are aimed at detecting the axion fluid. One of them, <a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/admx/index.shtml\">ADMX</a> (Axion Dark Matter eXperiment) uses specially crafted, ultrasensitive antennas to convert background axions into electromagnetic pulses. The other, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6089\">CASPEr</a> (Cosmic Axion Spin Precession Experiment) looks for tiny wiggles in the motion of nuclear spins, which would be induced by the axion fluid. Between them, these difficult experiments promise to cover almost the entire range of possible axion masses.</p>
<p>Do axions exist? We still don’t know for sure. Their existence would bring the story of time’s reversible arrow to a dramatic, satisfying conclusion, and very possibly solve the riddle of the dark matter, to boot.

<p>Few facts of experience are as obvious and pervasive as the distinction between past and future. We remember one, but anticipate the other. If you run a movie backwards, it doesn&#8217;t look realistic. We say there is an <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20140416-times-arrow-traced-to-quantum-source/\">arrow of time</a>, which points from past to future.</p>
<p>One might expect that a fact as basic as the existence of time’s arrow would be embedded in the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150803-physics-theories-map/\">fundamental laws of physics</a>. But the opposite is true. If you could take a movie of subatomic events, you’d find that the backward-in-time version looks perfectly reasonable. Or, put more precisely: The fundamental laws of physics — up to some tiny, esoteric exceptions, as we’ll soon discuss — will look to be obeyed, whether we follow the flow of time forward or backward. In the fundamental laws, time’s arrow is reversible.</p>

<p>Logically speaking, the transformation that reverses the direction of time might have changed the fundamental laws. Common sense would suggest that it should. But it does not. Physicists use convenient shorthand — also called jargon — to describe that fact. They call the transformation that reverses the arrow of time “time reversal,” or simply T. And they refer to the (approximate) fact that T does not change the fundamental laws as “T invariance,” or “T symmetry.”</p>
<p>Everyday experience violates T invariance, while the fundamental laws respect it. That blatant mismatch raises challenging questions. <em>How</em> does the actual world, whose <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150813-how-does-symmetry-shape-natures-laws/\">fundamental laws respect T symmetry</a>, manage to look so asymmetric? Is it possible that someday we’ll encounter beings with the opposite flow — beings who grow younger as we grow older? Might we, through some physical process, turn around our own body’s arrow of time?</p>
<div id=\"attachment_18094\" class=\"wp-caption 
<p>Those are great questions, and I hope to write about them in a <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">past</span> future posting. Here, however, I want to consider a complementary question. It arises when we start from the other end, in the facts of common experience. From that perspective, the puzzle is this:</p>
<p><em>Why should the fundamental laws have that bizarre and problem-posing property, T invariance? </em></p>
<p>The answer we can offer today is incomparably deeper and more sophisticated than that we could offer 50 years ago. Today’s understanding emerged from a brilliant interplay of experimental discovery and theoretical analysis, which yielded several Nobel prizes. Yet our answer still contains a serious loophole. As I’ll explain, closing that loophole may well lead us, as an unexpected bonus, to identify the cosmological “<a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150820-the-case-for-complex-dark-matter/\">dark matter</a>.”</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\">II.</p>
<p>The modern history of T invariance begins in 1956. In that year, <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1957/\">T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang</a> <a href=\"http://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.104.254\">questioned a different but related feature of physical law</a>, which until then had been taken for granted. Lee and Yang were not concerned with T itself, but with its spatial analogue, the parity transformation, “P.” Whereas T involves looking at movies run backward in time, P involves looking at movies reflected in a mirror. Parity invariance is the hypothesis that the events you see in the reflected movies follow the same laws as the originals. Lee and Yang identified circumstantial evidence against that hypothesis and suggested critical experiments to test it. Within a few months, experiments proved that P invariance fails in many circumstances. (P invariance holds for gravitational, electromagnetic and strong interactions, but generally fails in the so-called weak interactions.)</p>
<p>Those dramatic developments around P (non)invariance stimulated physicists to question T invariance, a kindred assumption they had also once taken for granted. But the hypothesis of T invariance survived close scrutiny for several years. It was only in 1964 that a group led by <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1980/\">James Cronin and Valentine Fitch</a> <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.13.138\">discovered a peculiar, tiny effect in the decays of K mesons</a> that violates T invariance.</p>
<p style=\"text-align: center;\">III.</p>
<p>The wisdom of Joni Mitchell&#8217;s insight — that “you don&#8217;t know what you’ve got ‘til it&#8217;s gone” — was proven in the aftermath.</p>
<p>If, like small children, we keep asking, &#8220;Why?&#8221; we may get deeper answers for a while, but eventually we will hit bottom, when we arrive at a truth that we can’t explain in terms of anything simpler. At that point we must call a halt, in effect declaring victory: “That’s just the way it is.” But if we later find exceptions to our supposed truth, that answer will no longer do. We will have to keep going.</p>
<p>As long as T invariance appeared to be a universal truth, it wasn’t clear that our italicized question was a useful one. Why was the universe T invariant? It just was. But after Cronin and Fitch, the mystery of T invariance could not be avoided.</p>
<p>Many theoretical physicists struggled with the vexing challenge of understanding how T invariance could be extremely accurate, yet not quite exact. Here the work of <a href=\"http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/\">Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa</a> proved decisive. In 1973, they <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1143/PTP.49.652\">proposed</a> that approximate T invariance is an accidental consequence of other, more-profound principles.</p>

") (commentRss nil "https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160107-arrow-of-time-axions/feed/") (comments nil "14"))) ("String Theory Meets Loop Quantum Gravity" "<p>Eight decades have passed since physicists realized that the theories of quantum mechanics and gravity don’t fit together, and the puzzle of how to combine the two remains unsolved. In the last few decades, researchers have pursued the problem in two separate programs — string theory and loop quantum gravity — that are widely considered incompatible by their practitioners. But now some scientists argue that joining forces is the way forward.</p>
<p>Among the attempts to unify quantum theory and gravity, string theory has attracted the most attention. Its premise is simple: Everything is made of tiny strings. The strings may be closed unto themselves or have loose ends; they can vibrate, stretch, join or split. And in these manifold appearances lie the explanations for all phenomena we observe, both matter and space-time included.</p>
<p>Loop quantum gravity, by contrast, is concerned less with the matter that inhibits space-time than with the quantum properties of space-time itself. In loop quantum gravity, or LQG, space-time is a network. The smooth background of Einstein’s theory of gravity is replaced by nodes and links to which quantum properties are assigned. In this way, space is built up of discrete chunks. LQG is in large part a study of these chunks.</p>
<p>This approach has long been thought incompatible with string theory. Indeed, the conceptual differences are obvious and profound. For starters, LQG studies bits of space-time, whereas string theory investigates the behavior of objects within space-time. Specific technical problems separate the fields. String theory requires that space-time have 10 dimensions; LQG doesn’t work in higher dimensions. String theory also implies the existence of supersymmetry, in which all known particles have yet-undiscovered partners. Supersymmetry isn’t a feature of LQG.</p>
<p>These and other differences have split the theoretical physics community into deeply divergent camps. “Conferences have segregated,” said <a href=\"http://www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/pullin/\">Jorge Pullin</a>, a physicist at Louisiana State University and co-author of an <a href=\"http://www.afirstcourseinloopquantumgravity.com/\">LQG textbook</a>. “Loopy people go to loopy conferences. Stringy people go to stringy conferences. They don’t even go to ‘physics’ conferences anymore. I think it’s unfortunate that it developed this way.”</p>

<p>But a number of factors may be pushing the camps closer together. New theoretical findings have revealed potential similarities between LQG and string theory. A young generation of string theorists has begun to look outside string theory for methods and tools that might be useful in the quest to understand how to create a “theory of everything.” And a still-raw paradox involving black holes and information loss has given everyone a fresh dose of humility.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the absence of experimental evidence for either string theory or LQG, mathematical proof that the two are in fact opposite sides of the same coin would bolster the argument that physicists are progressing toward the correct theory of everything.

<p><strong>An Unexpected Link</strong></p>
<p>An effort to solve some of LQG’s own internal problems has led to the first surprising link with string theory. Physicists who study LQG lack a clear understanding of how to zoom out from their network of space-time chunks and arrive at a large-scale description of space-time that dovetails with Einstein’s general theory of relativity — our best theory of gravity. More worrying still, their theory can’t reconcile the special case in which gravity can be neglected. It’s a malaise that befalls any approach reliant on chunking-up space-time: In Einstein’s theory of special relativity, an object will appear to contract depending on how fast an observer is moving relative to it. This contraction also affects the size of space-time chunks, which are then perceived differently by observers with different velocities. The discrepancy leads to problems with the central tenet of Einstein’s theory — that the laws of physics should hold no matter what the observer’s velocity.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult to introduce discrete structures without running into difficulties with special relativity,” said Pullin. In a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2610\">brief paper</a> he wrote in 2014 with frequent collaborator Rodolfo Gambini, a physicist at the University of the Republic in Montevideo, Uruguay, Pullin argued that making LQG compatible with special relativity necessitates interactions that are similar to those found in string theory.</p>
<p>That the two approaches have something in common seemed likely to Pullin since a seminal discovery in the late 1990s by <a href=\"https://www.ias.edu/people/faculty-and-emeriti/maldacena\">Juan Maldacena</a>, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Maldacena matched up a gravitational theory in a so-called anti-de Sitter (AdS) space-time with a field theory (CFT — the “C” is for “conformal”) on the boundary of the space-time. By using this AdS/CFT identification, the gravitational theory can be described by the better-understood field theory.</p>
<p>The full version of the duality is a conjecture, but it has a well-understood limiting case that string theory plays no role in. Because strings don’t matter in this limiting case, it should be shared by any theory of quantum gravity. Pullin sees this as a contact point.</p>

<p><a href=\"http://physics.princeton.edu/~verlinde/\">Herman Verlinde</a>, a theoretical physicist at Princeton University who frequently works on string theory, finds it plausible that methods from LQG can help illuminate the gravity side of the duality. In a <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05069\">recent paper</a>, Verlinde looked at AdS/CFT in a simplified model with only two dimensions of space and one of time, or “2+1” as physicists say. He found that the AdS space can be described by a network like those used in LQG. Even though the construction presently only works in 2+1, it offers a new way to think about gravity. Verlinde hopes to generalize the model to higher dimensions. “Loop quantum gravity has been seen too narrowly. My approach is to be inclusive. It’s much more intellectually forward-looking,” he said.</p>
<p>But even having successfully combined LQG methods with string theory to make headway in anti-de Sitter space, the question remains: How useful is that combination? Anti-de Sitter space-times have a negative cosmological constant (a number that describes the large-scale geometry of the universe); our universe has a positive one. We just don’t inhabit the mathematical construct that is AdS space.</p>
<p>Verlinde is pragmatic. “One idea is that [for a positive cosmological constant] one needs a totally new theory,” he said. “Then the question is how different that theory is going to look. AdS is at the moment the best hint for the structure we are looking for, and then we have to find the twist to get a positive cosmological constant.” He thinks it’s time well spent: “Though [AdS] doesn’t describe our world, it will teach us some lessons that will guide us where to go.”</p>
<p><strong>Coming Together in a Black Hole</strong></p>
<p>Verlinde and Pullin both point to another chance for the string theory and loop quantum gravity communities to come together: the mysterious fate of information that <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150508-what-happens-when-you-fall-into-a-black-hole/\">falls into a black hole</a>. In 2012, four researchers based at the University of California, Santa Barbara, <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20121221-alice-and-bob-meet-the-wall-of-fire/\">highlighted an internal contradiction</a> in the prevailing theory. They argued that requiring a black hole to let information escape would destroy the delicate structure of empty space around the black hole’s horizon, thereby creating a highly energetic barrier — a black hole “firewall.” This firewall, however, is incompatible with the equivalence principle that underlies general relativity, which holds that observers can’t tell whether they’ve crossed the horizon. The incompatibility roiled string theorists, who thought they understood black hole information and now must revisit their notebooks.</p>
<p>But this isn’t a conundrum only for string theorists. “This whole discussion about the black hole firewalls took place mostly within the string theory community, which I don’t understand,” Verlinde said. “These questions about quantum information, and entanglement, and how to construct a [mathematical] Hilbert space – that’s exactly what people in loop quantum gravity have been working on for a long time.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a development that went unnoted by much of the string community, the barrier once posed by supersymmetry and extra dimensions has fallen as well. A group around <a href=\"https://www.gravity.physik.fau.de/members/people/thiemann.shtml\">Thomas Thiemann</a> at Friedrich-Alexander University in Erlangen, Germany, has <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1103\">extended LQG to higher dimensions and included supersymmetry</a>, both of which were formerly the territory of string theory.</p>
<p>More recently, <a href=\"http://ktwig.fuw.edu.pl/1,1,7,p-36,dr-norbert-bodendorfer-humboldt-fellow.html\">Norbert Bodendorfer</a>, a former student of Thiemann’s who is now at the University of Warsaw, <a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02036\">has applied</a> methods of LQG’s loop quantization to anti-de Sitter space. He argues that LQG can be useful for the AdS/CFT duality in situations where string theorists don’t know how to perform gravitational computations. Bodendorfer feels that the former chasm between string theory and LQG is fading away. “On some occasions I’ve had the impression that string theorists knew very little about LQG and didn’t want to talk about it,” he said. “But [the] younger people in string theory, they are very open-minded. They are very interested what is going on at the interface.”</p>
<p>“The biggest difference is in how we define our questions,” said Verlinde. “It’s more sociological than scientific, unfortunately.” He doesn’t think the two approaches are in conflict: “I’ve always viewed [string theory and loop quantum gravity] as parts of the same description. LQG is a method, it’s not a theory. It’s a method to think of quantum mechanics and geometry. It’s a method that string theorists can use and are actually using. These things are not incompatible.”</p>
<p>Not everyone is so convinced. <a href=\"https://www.phas.ubc.ca/users/moshe-rozali\">Moshe Rozali</a>, a string theorist at the University of British Columbia, remains skeptical of LQG: “The reason why I personally don’t work on LQG is the issue with special relativity,” he said. “If your approach does not respect the symmetries of special relativity from the outset, then you basically need a miracle to happen at one of your intermediate steps.” Still, Rozali said, some of the mathematical tools developed in LQG might come in handy. “I don’t think that there is any likelihood that string theory and LQG are going to converge to some middle ground,” he said. “But the methods are what people normally care about, and these are similar enough; the mathematical methods could have some overlap.”</p>
<p>Not everyone on the LQG side expects the two will merge either. <a href=\"http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~rovelli/\">Carlo Rovelli</a>, a physicist at the University of Marseille and a founding father of LQG, believes his field ascendant. “The string planet is infinitely less arrogant than ten years ago, especially after the bitter disappointment of the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20121120-as-supersymmetry-fails-tests-physicists-seek-new-ideas/\">non-appearance of supersymmetric particles</a>,” he said. “It is possible that the two theories could be parts of a common solution … but I myself think it is unlikely. String theory seems to me to have failed to deliver what it had promised in the ’80s, and is one of the many ‘nice-idea-but-nature-is-not-like-that’ that dot the history of science. I do not really understand how can people still have hope in it.”</p>
<p>For Pullin, declaring victory seems premature: “There are LQG people now saying, ‘We are the only game in town.’ I don’t subscribe to this way of arguing.

(encoded nil "<p>Eight decades have passed since physicists realized that the theories of quantum mechanics and gravity don’t fit together, and the puzzle of how to combine the two remains unsolved. In the last few decades, researchers have pursued the problem in two separate programs — string theory and loop quantum gravity — that are widely considered incompatible by their practitioners. But now some scientists argue that joining forces is the way forward.</p>
<p>Among the attempts to unify quantum theory and gravity, string theory has attracted the most attention. Its premise is simple: Everything is made of tiny strings. The strings may be closed unto themselves or have loose ends; they can vibrate, stretch, join or split. And in these manifold appearances lie the explanations for all phenomena we observe, both matter and space-time included.</p>
<p>Loop quantum gravity, by contrast, is concerned less with the matter that inhibits space-time than with the quantum properties of space-time itself. In loop quantum gravity, or LQG, space-time is a network. The smooth background of Einstein’s theory of gravity is replaced by nodes and links to which quantum properties are assigned. In this way, space is built up of discrete chunks. LQG is in large part a study of these chunks.</p>
<p>This approach has long been thought incompatible with string theory. Indeed, the conceptual differences are obvious and profound. For starters, LQG studies bits of space-time, whereas string theory investigates the behavior of objects within space-time. Specific technical problems separate the fields. String theory requires that space-time have 10 dimensions; LQG doesn’t work in higher dimensions. String theory also implies the existence of supersymmetry, in which all known particles have yet-undiscovered partners. Supersymmetry isn’t a feature of LQG.</p>
<p>These and other differences have split the theoretical physics community into deeply divergent camps. “Conferences have segregated,” said <a href=\"http://www.phys.lsu.edu/faculty/pullin/\">Jorge Pullin</a>, a physicist at Louisiana State University and co-author of an <a href=\"http://www.afirstcourseinloopquantumgravity.com/\">LQG textbook</a>. “Loopy people go to loopy conferences. Stringy people go to stringy conferences. They don’t even go to ‘physics’ conferences anymore. I think it’s unfortunate that it developed this way.”</p>

We accept that both perceptions are equally valid and that it is fruitless to debate which one is “right.” Most of us imagine that such radically different views of the same object cannot occur in the realm of mathematics; after all, we are taught to think that every problem has a single correct answer. As we saw in <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150730-the-slippery-eel-of-probability/\">“The Slippery Eel of Probability,”</a> this is not always the case when the technique to be used in solving the problem is not given. For this month’s Insights puzzle, we consider a famous problem that has divided people across the board and generated endless debate: the Sleeping Beauty problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>The famous fairy-tale princess Sleeping Beauty participates in an experiment that starts on Sunday. She is told that she will be put to sleep, and while she is asleep a fair coin will be tossed that will determine how the experiment will proceed. If the coin comes up heads, she will be awakened on Monday, interviewed, and put back to sleep, but she won’t remember this awakening. If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday, again without remembering either awakening. In either case, the experiment ends when she is awakened on Wednesday without being interviewed.</p>
<p>Whenever Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed, she won’t know which day it is or whether she has been awakened before. During each awakening, she is asked: “What is your degree of certainty that the coin landed heads?” What should her answer be?</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble picturing the problem, Julia Galef explains it nicely in this video:</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL52lG6aNIY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>
<p>This problem has intuitively appealing solutions that are so entrenched that they have been given names: the <strong>thirder</strong> position and the <strong>halfer</strong> position. Before we review these, remember that in the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150604-quantum-bayesianism-qbism/\">Bayesian view of probability</a>, the degree of subjective certainty is constantly updated by new knowledge. Thus, if we knew nothing about a coin toss except that the coin was fair, our subjective probability of it being heads is one-half. But if a hundred reliable witnesses tell us that it was heads, or we see a video of the event, our subjective probability can change from one-half to one.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the thirders and halfers apply this notion to the above problem.</p>
<p>Thirders argue that in the universe of possibilities, there are three possible situations in which Sleeping Beauty could have been awakened, which are indistinguishable to her. The coin could have come up heads and it is Monday, the coin could have come up tails and it is Monday, or the coin could have come up tails and it is Tuesday. Each of these is equally likely from her perspective, so the probability of each is one-third. So her subjective probability that the coin came up heads is one-third.</p>
<div id=\"attachment_17483\" class=\"wp-caption
<p>“Not so fast!” cry the halfers. Since the coin was fair, the chance that it came up heads is half. Sleeping Beauty has received no new information about the result of the coin toss when she is woken up. So her subjective probability that the coin came up heads should continue to be half.</p>
<p>Think about both of these positions, and let us know what position the Necker cube of your mind lands on. Do add your thoughts to the animated debate on this question, which is already extensive, as a Google search will demonstrate. Below we present two variations on this classic problem. In these versions, you have to make a life-or-death decision based on what you believe. But first, here’s a curious coincidence — the type that makes people go, “What are the chances of that?” On January 11, the Insights team decided to feature the Sleeping Beauty problem this month. The next day we discovered that January 12 is the birthday of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/google/google-doodle/12093512/Who-was-Charles-Perrault-Why-the-fairy-tales-you-know-may-not-be-as-they-seem.html\">Charles Perrault</a>, the original author of the Sleeping Beauty story. Perrault was born in Paris on January 12, 1628. Feel free to weigh in on how often such surprising and rare coincidences have happened to you; I have expressed my views on this phenomenon in a suite of puzzles <a href=\"http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/19/numberplay-rare-coincidences-are-very-common/\">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<p>OK, now it’s time to put your life on the line. Here are two new variations of the intriguing Sleeping Beauty problem, in a brilliant scenario created by <em>Quanta</em> reader <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150730-the-slippery-eel-of-probability/#comment-353047\">eJ</a>, which I felt needed to be better known and discussed. In both of these variations, you are Sleeping Beauty, and you are awakened based on the result of the coin toss and made to forget this fact, as before. However, the experiment is being performed by evil alien scientists who have kidnapped you, and they ask you to make what turns out to be a life-or-death choice. Now your subjective probability is not just a hypothetical concept: It actually affects your chances of coming out of the situation alive. The correct choice will maximize your chance of survival. Will you stick to your original conclusion, or will you let your mental Necker cube flip?</p>
<p>Variation 1:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon each awakening, Sleeping Beauty is presented with two bags of beans, marked “H” and “T.” She is instructed to reach into one bag, grab a single bean, and put it aside. At the end of the experiment, she will have to eat the bean or beans that she has pulled. She is told that the bags are filled with identical looking jellybeans (J) or poisoned pills (K), as follows:</p>
<p>* If the coin came up heads, bag H has 7J, and bag T has 7K.</p>
<p>* If the coin came up tails, bag H has 1J and 6K, while bag T has 6J and 1K.</p>
<p>You are Sleeping Beauty. Which bag would you pick, and what are your chances of survival?</p></blockquote>
<p>Variation 2:</p>
<blockquote><p>You, as Sleeping Beauty, are told that you have to go through the original experiment (without the beans) every week for many months, and the memory of each waking will be wiped from your memory. The evil chief scientist has determined that on your hundredth awakening in this series of experiments, you will be presented with the two bags of beans and instructed exactly as in Variation 1 above. If you pick a poisoned pill, you will die; otherwise, you will go free. Now which bag do you pick, and what are your chances of surviving?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudos to eJ for making the Sleeping Beauty scenario concrete in such an interesting fashion. They say the thought of death, even in imagination, focuses the mind like nothing else. Does it work that way for you? Happy puzzling, and may the insight be with you!</p>

(encoded nil "<p>We are used to the idea that perception can be ambiguous — there are visual illusions such as the famous Necker cube that can be perceived in two completely different ways. We accept that both perceptions are equally valid and that it is fruitless to debate which one is “right.” Most of us imagine that such radically different views of the same object cannot occur in the realm of mathematics; after all, we are taught to think that every problem has a single correct answer. As we saw in <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150730-the-slippery-eel-of-probability/\">“The Slippery Eel of Probability,”</a> this is not always the case when the technique to be used in solving the problem is not given. For this month’s Insights puzzle, we consider a famous problem that has divided people across the board and generated endless debate: the Sleeping Beauty problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>The famous fairy-tale princess Sleeping Beauty participates in an experiment that starts on Sunday. She is told that she will be put to sleep, and while she is asleep a fair coin will be tossed that will determine how the experiment will proceed. If the coin comes up heads, she will be awakened on Monday, interviewed, and put back to sleep, but she won’t remember this awakening. If the coin comes up tails, she will be awakened and interviewed on Monday and Tuesday, again without remembering either awakening. In either case, the experiment ends when she is awakened on Wednesday without being interviewed.</p>
<p>Whenever Sleeping Beauty is awakened and interviewed, she won’t know which day it is or whether she has been awakened before. During each awakening, she is asked: &#8220;What is your degree of certainty that the coin landed heads?&#8221; What should her answer be?</p>
<p>If you’re having trouble picturing the problem, Julia Galef explains it nicely in this video:</p></blockquote>
<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zL52lG6aNIY\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>
<p>This problem has intuitively appealing solutions that are so entrenched that they have been given names: the <strong>thirder</strong> position and the <strong>halfer</strong> position. Before we review these, remember that in the <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150604-quantum-bayesianism-qbism/\">Bayesian view of probability</a>, the degree of subjective certainty is constantly updated by new knowledge. Thus, if we knew nothing about a coin toss except that the coin was fair, our subjective probability of it being heads is one-half. But if a hundred reliable witnesses tell us that it was heads, or we see a video of the event, our subjective probability can change from one-half to one.</p>
<p>Let’s see how the thirders and halfers apply this notion to the above problem.</p>
<p>Thirders argue that in the universe of possibilities, there are three possible situations in which Sleeping Beauty could have been awakened, which are indistinguishable to her. The coin could have come up heads and it is Monday, the coin could have come up tails and it is Monday, or the coin could have come up tails and it is Tuesday. Each of these is equally likely from her perspective, so the probability of each is one-third. So her subjective probability that the coin came up heads is one-third.</p>

<p>“Not so fast!” cry the halfers. Since the coin was fair, the chance that it came up heads is half. Sleeping Beauty has received no new information about the result of the coin toss when she is woken up. So her subjective probability that the coin came up heads should continue to be half.</p>
